# Dev Log #1: "Why I'm Building a Meal Timing App"
## YouTube Video Script (Target: 8-10 minutes)

---

## [0:00-0:05] HOOK
**[ON SCREEN: B-roll of various diet apps on phone]**

"I tracked my calories perfectly for 6 months and still felt exhausted every afternoon. Then I discovered something that changed everything..."

---

## [0:05-0:15] INTRODUCTION
**[ON SCREEN: Face to camera]**

"Hey, I'm Brennen. I'm a solo developer building NutriSync - an smart meal planner that focuses on WHEN you eat, not just what you eat. And today I want to share why I'm building this and give you exclusive access to the beta."

## [0:15-1:30] THE PROBLEM (Personal Story)
**[ON SCREEN: Screen recording of MyFitnessPal, showing perfect macro tracking]**

"Like many of you, I was obsessed with hitting my macros. 2,200 calories. 180g protein. Perfect on paper.

**[Cut to: Energy level graph showing afternoon crashes]**

But every day at 2 PM, I'd hit a wall. Brain fog. Zero motivation. Coffee wasn't helping.

**[ON SCREEN: Research papers, highlight key findings]**

Then I started diving into circadian rhythm research. Turns out, eating the exact same meal at 2 PM versus 7 PM can result in completely different metabolic responses. Your body processes nutrients differently based on:
- Your sleep-wake cycle
- Hormone fluctuations throughout the day
- Your activity patterns
- Even your genetics

**[ON SCREEN: Show transformation - energy levels improving]**

When I shifted my eating windows based on this science, everything changed. Same calories, same macros, but I had energy all day. Better sleep. Better workouts."

---

## [1:30-3:00] THE SOLUTION CONCEPT
**[ON SCREEN: Figma mockups of NutriSync]**

"That's when I realized - we're tracking the wrong thing. Apps obsess over WHAT you eat but ignore WHEN you eat.

**[Show app flow mockup]**

So I'm building NutriSync. Here's how it works:

1. **Morning Check-in**: Tell the app how you slept, what's on your schedule
2. **AI Window Generation**: It creates personalized eating windows for YOUR day
3. **Photo-based tracking**: Just snap a photo - AI analyzes your meal instantly
4. **Real-time adaptation**: Missed a window? It redistributes your nutrition automatically

**[ON SCREEN: Show competitor apps]**

This isn't another intermittent fasting timer. It's not MyFitnessPal with a clock. It's a complete rethinking of nutrition timing."

---

## [3:00-5:00] TECHNICAL DEEP DIVE
**[ON SCREEN: Xcode with actual code]**

"Let me show you what I've built so far. 

**[Screen recording: Live coding session]**

Here's the AI meal analysis system using Google's Gemini Flash API:

```swift
// Show actual MealAnalysisAgent.swift code
// Explain the photo → AI → nutrition data pipeline
```

The coolest part? It asks clarifying questions when it's not sure. 'Is that chicken breast or thigh?' 'About how many ounces?'

**[Show Firebase console]**

Everything syncs through Firebase in real-time. Your meal photos, nutrition data, personalized windows - all encrypted and private.

**[Show cost breakdown]**

And I've optimized the AI calls to cost less than 3 cents per meal scan. That means I can keep the app affordable."

---

## [5:00-6:30] CURRENT PROGRESS & CHALLENGES
**[ON SCREEN: GitHub commits, project board]**

"I've been building this for 3 months now. Here's where we're at:

**COMPLETED:**
✅ AI meal analysis (95% accuracy on common foods)
✅ Personalized window generation 
✅ Morning check-in flow
✅ Real-time macro tracking

**THIS WEEK'S FOCUS:**
🔨 Fixing midnight crossover bug (meal at 11:59 PM breaks everything)
🔨 Voice input for quick logging
🔨 Dark mode UI polish

**[Show actual bug in simulator]**

Here's the bug I'm fighting right now - when someone logs a meal right at midnight, the redistribution engine doesn't know which day it belongs to. Classic edge case that real users found immediately."

---

## [6:30-7:30] BETA TESTER FEEDBACK
**[ON SCREEN: Screenshots of beta feedback messages]**

"We have 147 beta testers so far, and the feedback has been incredible:

**[Read actual testimonials]**

'Finally an app that adapts to my night shift schedule!' - Sarah, RN

'I've stopped having afternoon crashes completely' - Mike

But also honest criticism:

'The UI needs work' - Fair point, I'm a developer not a designer!
'Needs Android version' - iOS only for now, sorry!

**[Show before/after UI improvements based on feedback]**

Every piece of feedback shapes the app. Look how the meal logging flow evolved based on user input..."

## [8:30-9:00] WHAT'S NEXT
**[ON SCREEN: Calendar showing launch date]**

"Next week, I'm tackling:
- The workout nutrition timing system
- Micronutrient tracking
- The redistribution algorithm for missed meals

**[Show roadmap]**

October 1st - that's our App Store launch date. 

Every Monday, I'll share development progress. 
Wednesdays, we'll dive into the science of meal timing.
Fridays, I'll showcase new features based on YOUR feedback.

**[Face to camera for closing]**

This isn't just about building an app. It's about questioning the conventional wisdom that calories are all that matter. It's about optimizing not just what we eat, but when we eat it."

- **Energy**: Enthusiastic but authentic, not overly salesy
- **Pacing**: Quick cuts during technical parts, slower during story
- **B-roll needed**: 
  - Screen recordings of app
  - Coding sessions
  - Energy level graphs
  - Research papers
  - Beta tester testimonials
- **Music**: Subtle, upbeat background track (YouTube Audio Library)
- **Thumbnail**: Split screen - exhausted vs. energized with clock showing different times

## KEY METRICS TO MENTION:
- 147 current beta testers
- 95% meal analysis accuracy  
- <3 cents per AI analysis
- October 1st launch date
- 350 TestFlight spots remaining
