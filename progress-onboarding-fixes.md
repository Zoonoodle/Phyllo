- LifestyleFactorsView.swift
- NutritionPreferencesView.swift
- EnergyPatternsView.swift
- NotificationPreferencesView.swift
- WorkoutScheduleView.swift
- BodyFatLevelView.swift
- MissedWindowNudge.swift

#### ✅ A2. Updated Navigation Flow
- Updated OnboardingSectionData.swift to remove deleted screens
- Recalculated step counts (31 → 23 steps)
- Updated section definitions maintaining 5 sections
- Fixed navigation indices for remaining screens

#### ✅ A3. Cleaned Up Data Model
- Removed unused coordinator properties:
  - bodyFatPercentage
  - workoutDays, workoutTime
  - breakfastHabit
  - calorieDistribution
  - workSchedule, socialMealsPerWeek, travelFrequency
  - foodSensitivities, macroPreference
  - energyPeak, caffeineSensitivity
  - windowStartNotifications, windowEndNotifications, checkInReminders, notificationMinutesBefore
- Updated buildProgressObject() function
- Updated loadExistingProgress() function
- Removed MissedWindowNudge from NudgeManager enum
- Removed MissedWindowNudge case from NudgeContainer
- Updated OnboardingPreview screen list

#### ✅ Testing
- All edited files compile successfully
- Changes committed to git

## Next Steps: PHASE B (Fix Broken Functionality)

### B1. Implement TDEE Calculation ⏳
- [ ] Create TDEECalculator utility with Mifflin-St Jeor formula
- [ ] Add activity level selection in ExpenditureView
- [ ] Implement +/- manual adjustment buttons when user selects "No"
- [ ] Display calculated value instead of hardcoded 1805

### B2. Fix Weight Loss Rate Slider ⏳
- [ ] Make slider interactive with real drag gesture
- [ ] Calculate actual weight loss projections based on position
- [ ] Update display values dynamically (lbs/week and lbs/month)
- [ ] Add haptic feedback on value changes

### B3. Fix Target Weight Slider ⏳
- [ ] Simplify drag gesture (remove damping factor)
- [ ] Add sub-header text: "Drag to select your goal weight"
- [ ] Improve ruler sensitivity
- [ ] Add unit switching (lbs/kg)
- [ ] Fix snapping to whole numbers

### B4. Split Workout Nutrition Screen ⏳
- [ ] Create PreWorkoutNutritionView.swift
- [ ] Create PostWorkoutNutritionView.swift
- [ ] Update navigation flow to include both screens
- [ ] Move relevant options to each screen

## Files Modified in Phase A

### Deleted (9 files)
1. CalorieDistributionView.swift
2. BreakfastHabitView.swift
3. LifestyleFactorsView.swift
4. NutritionPreferencesView.swift
5. EnergyPatternsView.swift
6. NotificationPreferencesView.swift
7. WorkoutScheduleView.swift
8. BodyFatLevelView.swift
9. MissedWindowNudge.swift

### Modified (5 files)
1. OnboardingSectionData.swift - Removed screen references
2. OnboardingCoordinator.swift - Removed unused properties
3. OnboardingPreview.swift - Updated preview list
4. NudgeManager.swift - Removed missedWindow case
5. NudgeContainer.swift - Removed missedWindow handling

## Summary
Phase A successfully reduced the onboarding flow from 31 to 23 screens by removing unnecessary or redundant screens. The codebase has been cleaned up, all references to deleted screens have been removed, and the project compiles successfully.

Ready to proceed with Phase B: Fix Broken Functionality.

## Context Usage
Approximately 35% of context used. Safe to continue with Phase B implementation.
