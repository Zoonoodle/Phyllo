- ✅ Created TDEECalculator utility with Mifflin-St Jeor formula
- ✅ Added activity level selection in ExpenditureView
- ✅ Implemented +/- manual adjustment buttons when user selects "No"
- ✅ Display calculated value instead of hardcoded 1805

### B2. Fix Weight Loss Rate Slider ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Made slider interactive with real drag gesture
- ✅ Calculate actual weight loss projections based on position
- ✅ Update display values dynamically (lbs/week and lbs/month)
- ✅ Add haptic feedback on value changes
- ✅ Added gradient colors and warnings for extreme rates

### B3. Fix Target Weight Slider ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Simplified drag gesture (removed damping factor)
- ✅ Added sub-header text: "Drag to select your goal weight"
- ✅ Improved ruler sensitivity
- ✅ Added unit switching (lbs/kg)
- ✅ Fixed snapping to whole numbers

### B4. Split Workout Nutrition Screen ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Created PreWorkoutNutritionView.swift
- ✅ Created PostWorkoutNutritionView.swift
- ✅ Updated navigation flow to include both screens
- ✅ Moved relevant options to each screen with enhanced UI

## Files Modified in Phase A

### Deleted (9 files)
1. CalorieDistributionView.swift
2. BreakfastHabitView.swift
3. LifestyleFactorsView.swift
4. NutritionPreferencesView.swift
5. EnergyPatternsView.swift
6. NotificationPreferencesView.swift
7. WorkoutScheduleView.swift
8. BodyFatLevelView.swift
9. MissedWindowNudge.swift

### Modified (5 files)
1. OnboardingSectionData.swift - Removed screen references
2. OnboardingCoordinator.swift - Removed unused properties
3. OnboardingPreview.swift - Updated preview list
4. NudgeManager.swift - Removed missedWindow case
5. NudgeContainer.swift - Removed missedWindow handling

## Summary
Phase A successfully reduced the onboarding flow from 31 to 23 screens by removing unnecessary or redundant screens. The codebase has been cleaned up, all references to deleted screens have been removed, and the project compiles successfully.

Ready to proceed with Phase B: Fix Broken Functionality.

## Files Created/Modified in Phase B

### Created (3 files)
1. TDEECalculator.swift - New utility for TDEE calculations
2. PreWorkoutNutritionView.swift - Pre-workout nutrition preferences
3. PostWorkoutNutritionView.swift - Post-workout recovery preferences

### Modified (8 files)
1. OnboardingCoordinator.swift - Added height, gender, age properties, updated navigation
2. BasicInfoView.swift - Now saves user data to coordinator
3. ExpenditureView.swift - Complete rewrite with TDEE calculation
4. WeightLossRateView.swift - Complete rewrite with interactive slider
5. TargetWeightView.swift - Enhanced with unit switching, better drag, sub-header
6. OnboardingSectionData.swift - Split workout nutrition into two screens
7. OnboardingPreview.swift - Updated screen numbering for new flow
8. WorkoutNutritionView.swift - Still exists but no longer used in flow

## Phase B Summary
Successfully fixed all broken functionality:
- TDEE now calculates based on real user data with Mifflin-St Jeor equation
- Weight Loss Rate slider is fully interactive with dynamic projections
- Target Weight slider has improved UX with unit switching and better sensitivity
- Workout nutrition split into dedicated pre and post-workout screens

Total screens: 24 (up from 23 due to workout nutrition split, but still down from original 31)
