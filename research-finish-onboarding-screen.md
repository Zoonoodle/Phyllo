// - Daily Calories: \(calculatedTDEE - deficit/surplus)
// - Protein: \(0.8-1.0 g/lb based on goal)
// - Carbs: \(based on diet preference)
// - Fat: \(remaining calories)
```

**Bottom Section - Key Insights**:
```swift
// 3 personalized insight cards:
1. "Your optimal eating window: \(startTime) - \(endTime)"
2. "Pre-workout meal: \(90 min before) for energy"
3. "Last meal: \(3 hrs before bed) for better sleep"
```

   ```
   Based on your stats:
   • TDEE: \(calculatedTDEE) calories/day
   • BMR: \(BMR) calories at rest
   • Activity boost: +\(activityCalories) calories
   ```

2. **🎯 Your \(goal) Strategy**
   ```
   For \(goal == "Lose Weight" ? "fat loss" : goal):
   • Daily target: \(targetCalories) calories
   • Weekly deficit/surplus: \(weeklyChange) calories
   • Projected timeline: \(weeks) weeks
   ```

3. **⏰ Circadian Optimization**
   ```
   Based on your schedule:
   • Wake time: \(wakeTime)
   • First meal: \(wakeTime + 1hr) (metabolism boost)
   • Last meal: \(bedTime - 3hrs) (sleep quality)
   • \(mealFrequency) meals across \(eatingWindow) hours
   ```

4. **🏋️ Training Integration**
   ```
   Your \(trainingPlan) schedule:
   • Pre-workout window: High carb focus
   • Post-workout window: Protein priority
   • Recovery meals: Enhanced portions
   ```

5. **🍽️ \(dietPreference) Macro Distribution**
   ```
   Your personalized macros:
   • Protein: \(proteinGrams)g (\(proteinPercentage)%)
   • Carbs: \(carbGrams)g (\(carbPercentage)%)
   • Fat: \(fatGrams)g (\(fatPercentage)%)
   ```

#### **Screen 4: What Happens Next** (Expectation Setting)
**Purpose**: Smooth transition to app usage

**Content Sections**:

1. **📱 Daily Experience**
   ```
   Each day you'll:
   • See your personalized meal windows
   • Log meals with AI photo analysis
   • Get real-time macro tracking
   • Receive eating reminders
   ```

2. **🔄 Adaptive System**
   ```
   Your plan evolves:
   • Weekly adjustments based on progress
   • AI learns your preferences
   • Windows adapt to schedule changes

## Implementation Recommendations

### Technical Requirements

1. **State Management**
```swift
@Observable class OnboardingCompletionViewModel {
    var processingState: ProcessingState = .calculating
    var calculatedProgram: PersonalizedProgram?
    var currentScreen: CompletionScreen = .processing
    
    func generateProgram() async {
        // Vertex AI calls
        // Macro calculations
        // Window generation
        // Insight creation
    }
}
```

2. **Animation Timing**
