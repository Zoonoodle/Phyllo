## Design Principles Applied

### 1. **Consistent with Weight Goal Screen**
- Same layout structure and navigation
- Similar data presentation (current vs target)
- Warning messages for aggressive goals
- Projected achievement dates

### 2. **Unique Interactive Elements**
- **Moon Phase Slider**: Circular, celestial theme for sleep
- **Waveform Slider**: Linear, shows energy patterns
- **Sun Dial Slider**: Arc-based, follows natural day cycle

### 3. **Color Usage (per brand guidelines)**
- Background: #0a0a0a (near black)
- Accent: #C0FF73 (lime green for selections)
- Text: White with opacity variations
- Warnings: Yellow for caution messages

### 4. **Information Hierarchy**
- Current state vs target state at top
- Interactive element as focal point
- Supporting strategies/benefits below
- Timeline and warnings at bottom

### 5. **Mobile-First Design**
- Touch-friendly slider sizes
- Clear visual feedback
- Haptic feedback on interactions
- Smooth animations for state changes

## Implementation Notes

Each slider would:
1. Use SwiftUI's gesture recognizers for smooth interaction
2. Provide haptic feedback at key points
3. Animate transitions between values
4. Update calculations in real-time
5. Show visual feedback for optimal ranges

The unique sliders make each goal feel special and memorable while maintaining consistency with the overall app design language.
