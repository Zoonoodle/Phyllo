## âœ… Completed Tasks

### Task 2.1: Update OnboardingCoordinator âœ…
**File:** `NutriSync/Views/Onboarding/NutriSyncOnboarding/OnboardingCoordinator.swift`
- Added Firebase imports (FirebaseAuth, FirebaseFirestore)
- Added Firebase integration properties (isSaving, saveError, showSaveError)
- Implemented saveProgressToFirebase() method with logging
- Implemented buildProgressObject() to convert data to OnboardingProgress
- Added loadExistingProgress() for resuming interrupted onboarding
- Added completeOnboarding() for atomic profile creation
- Implemented buildUserProfile() and buildUserGoals() helper methods
- Added save error alert and loading indicator UI

### Task 2.2: Implement Progressive Saving âœ…
**Automatic saving after each section:**
- Modified completeSection() to trigger automatic save
- Shows loading indicator during save operation
- Displays error alert if save fails with retry option
- User preference: Save after each section (not individual screens)
- User preference: Show error and pause on failure

### Task 2.3: Update ReviewProgramView âœ…
**File:** `NutriSync/Views/Onboarding/NutriSyncOnboarding/ReviewProgramView.swift`
- Added Firebase integration
- Connected to parent OnboardingCoordinator via EnvironmentObject
- Implemented startJourney() with atomic profile creation
- Added loading state during profile creation
- Added error handling with retry capability
- Navigation to MainTabView on success
- Added haptic feedback for success/error states
- User preference: Atomic profile creation with loading indicator

### Task 2.4: Handle Interrupted Onboarding âœ…
**File:** `NutriSync/Views/ContentView.swift`
- Updated to pass existingProgress to OnboardingCoordinator
- Already had logic to load onboarding progress in checkProfileExistence()
- OnboardingCoordinator now accepts and loads existing progress on appear

### Task 2.5: Update OnboardingProgress Model âœ…
**File:** `NutriSync/Models/OnboardingProgress.swift`
- Updated NotificationSettings to match onboarding data structure
- Added proper initialization with window notification preferences

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. **Section Completion**: User completes a section â†’ completeSection() called
2. **Auto-Save**: Immediately triggers saveProgressToFirebase()
3. **Progress Tracking**: Updates OnboardingProgress with current state
4. **Error Handling**: Shows alert if save fails, allows retry or continue
5. **Profile Creation**: ReviewProgramView calls completeOnboarding() atomically
6. **Resume Logic**: ContentView loads existing progress and passes to coordinator

### Type Corrections Made
- Fixed UserGoals.Goal and UserGoals.ActivityLevel references
- Corrected NutritionGoal construction with associated values
- Fixed weight/height conversions (kgâ†’lbs, cmâ†’inches)
- Updated NotificationSettings structure to match usage

## âœ… Testing Results

### Compilation Test
All edited files compile successfully without errors:
- OnboardingCoordinator.swift âœ…
- ReviewProgramView.swift âœ…
- ContentView.swift âœ…
- OnboardingProgress.swift âœ…

## ðŸ“‹ Remaining Tasks

### Still Pending:
1. **Add auto-save triggers to individual onboarding section views** 
   - Currently only saves at section completion
   - Could add field-level saves if needed

2. **Add dev dashboard reset for onboarding**
   - Create a developer settings view
   - Add button to reset onboarding completion flag
   - Useful for testing the flow repeatedly

## ðŸš€ Summary

Phase 2 Profile Integration is complete with:
- âœ… Firebase-integrated OnboardingCoordinator
- âœ… Progressive saving after each section
- âœ… Atomic profile creation in ReviewProgramView
- âœ… Interrupted onboarding resume support
- âœ… Error handling and loading states
- âœ… All compilation tests passing

The onboarding flow now:
1. Saves progress automatically after each section
2. Shows errors and allows retry if save fails
3. Resumes from last saved position if interrupted
4. Creates profile atomically at the end
5. Provides visual feedback during operations

**Next Steps:**
- The core functionality is complete
- Consider adding field-level auto-save if needed
- Add developer tools for testing (reset onboarding flag)
