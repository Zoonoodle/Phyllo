# NutriSync Progress Tracker
## Context Engineering Implementation

Last Updated: 2025-08-29

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus
**Working On:** SimplePerformanceView (Momentum tab)
**Session Context:** Implementing streamlined nutrition dashboard
**Context Window:** Fresh session - optimal for new feature work

---

## âœ… Completed Work

### Recent Commits (main branch)
- `a0f270b` feat: Replaced tabbed NutritionDashboardView with simplified SimplePerformanceView
- `32559a9` fix: Prevented meal windows from extending past bedtime
- `feb9edb` fix: Corrected bedtime date calculation (midnight crossing issue)
- `6651aff` fix: Expanded time-to-bed validation range for late sleepers
- `ba17392` fix: Handled midnight crossing in hoursAffectedBy function

### Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Removed tab-based navigation** in favor of single-view performance dashboard
2. **Firebase integration** remains priority (47+ files need migration from MockDataManager)
3. **Meal window logic** now handles edge cases (midnight, late sleepers)

---

## ðŸš§ Current State

### Active Files
- `NutriSync/Views/Momentum/SimplePerformanceView.swift` (modified, uncommitted)

### Technical Context
- **Platform:** iOS 17+ with SwiftUI 6
- **Architecture:** MVVM with @Observable
- **Data Layer:** Transitioning from MockDataManager â†’ FirebaseDataProvider
- **AI Integration:** Vertex AI (Gemini Flash/Pro) for meal analysis

### Known Issues
1. MockDataManager still present in 47+ files
2. Build timeouts with full xcodebuild (use file-specific compilation)
3. No real-time meal window redistribution when meals missed

---

## ðŸ”„ Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. Complete SimplePerformanceView implementation
2. Test compilation with: `swiftc -parse SimplePerformanceView.swift`
3. Commit if tests pass

### Short-term (Next 2-3 Sessions)
1. **Firebase Migration Sprint**
   - Search all MockDataManager usage: `rg "MockDataManager" --type swift`
   - Replace with FirebaseDataProvider systematically
   - Test each migration before committing

2. **AI Window Generation Fixes**
   - Midnight crossover edge cases
   - Workout-aware timing
   - Token usage optimization (<$0.03 per operation)

3. **UI Polish Phase**
   - Focus tab refinement based on user feedback
   - Animation improvements
   - Loading states implementation

---

## ðŸ“Š Metrics & Constraints

### Performance Targets
- Meal analysis: <10 seconds
- Window generation: <5 seconds  
- Clarification questions: â‰¤2 per meal
- AI operation cost: <$0.03

### Development Rules
- ALWAYS compile before committing
- Use `rg` for searching, not `find` or `grep`
- Push after EVERY feature/fix
- Test edge cases (midnight, timezone changes)

---

## ðŸ§­ Session Management

### When to Create New Session
- Context window approaching 40% usage
- Starting new feature/major fix
- After completing significant milestone
- Before complex refactoring

### What to Preserve
- Key decisions and rationale
- Discovered patterns/constraints
- Failed approaches (avoid repeating)
- File references for active work

## ðŸ’¡ Quick Commands

```bash
# Compile current work
swiftc -parse -sdk $(xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator --show-sdk-path) \
  -target arm64-apple-ios17.0 \
  NutriSync/Views/Momentum/SimplePerformanceView.swift

# Find MockDataManager usage
rg "MockDataManager" --type swift .

# Check git status
git status

# Commit pattern
git add -A && git commit -m "feat: description" && git push
```
