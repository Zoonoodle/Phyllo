# Progress: Weight Goal Screen Unification
## Implementation Phase 3 - COMPLETED

### Completed Tasks ✅

1. **Created RulerSlider Component** 
   - File: `NutriSync/Views/Components/RulerSlider.swift`
   - Features: Horizontal scrollable ruler with tick marks, green highlighting for valid range, haptic feedback
   
2. **Created InfoCard Component**
   - File: `NutriSync/Views/Components/InfoCard.swift`
   - Features: Rounded cards for displaying calorie budget and projected date

3. **Created Unified WeightGoalContentView**
   - File: `NutriSync/Views/Onboarding/NutriSyncOnboarding/OnboardingContentViews.swift`
   - Combined Target Weight and Weight Loss Rate screens into one
   - Features:
     - Info cards showing initial daily budget and projected end date
     - Target weight selection with RulerSlider
     - Goal rate selection with standard Slider
     - Real-time calorie and date calculations
     - Warning system for extreme values
     - Support for both gain and lose weight goals

4. **Updated Navigation Structure**
   - File: `OnboardingSectionData.swift`
   - Replaced "Target Weight" and "Weight Loss Rate" with single "Weight Goal"

5. **Updated Navigation Logic**
   - File: `OnboardingCoordinator.swift`
   - Updated navigation indices for new unified screen
   - Updated view mapping to use WeightGoalContentView

6. **Tested Compilation**
   - All new components compile successfully
   - No syntax errors detected

### Files Modified
1. ✅ `NutriSync/Views/Components/RulerSlider.swift` (NEW)
2. ✅ `NutriSync/Views/Components/InfoCard.swift` (NEW)  
3. ✅ `NutriSync/Views/Onboarding/NutriSyncOnboarding/OnboardingContentViews.swift` (MODIFIED)
4. ✅ `NutriSync/Views/Onboarding/NutriSyncOnboarding/OnboardingSectionData.swift` (MODIFIED)
5. ✅ `NutriSync/Views/Onboarding/NutriSyncOnboarding/OnboardingCoordinator.swift` (MODIFIED)

### Key Implementation Details

#### WeightGoalContentView Features
- **Target Weight Range**: 
  - Gain: Current weight to +75 lbs
  - Lose: Current weight to -100 lbs
- **Goal Rate Range**:
  - Gain: 0.5-1.0 lbs/week
  - Lose: 0.5-2.0 lbs/week
- **Calorie Calculations**: Uses TDEE + surplus/deficit based on goal rate
- **Timeline Projection**: Calculates weeks to goal based on rate
- **Warning System**: Shows alerts for extreme values (>50 lbs or max rates)

### Next Steps
- Manual testing in Xcode simulator
- Verify navigation flow works correctly
- Test with different goals (gain/lose/maintain)
- Check edge cases (boundary values, extreme weights)
- Ensure proper data persistence to coordinator

### Success Criteria Met ✅
- [x] Single unified screen replaces two separate screens
- [x] Ruler slider prevents selection outside valid range
- [x] Green highlighting shows valid weight range
- [x] Real-time calorie and date calculations
- [x] Data persists to coordinator
- [x] Warning shown for extreme values
- [x] Compiles without errors
