# Macro and Calorie Redistribution System - Research Analysis

## Executive Summary

This research document provides a comprehensive analysis of the NutriSync codebase to understand the current window system and prepare for implementing intelligent macro/calorie redistribution when users over or under-eat in meal windows.

**Current State**: Basic redistribution framework exists but needs significant enhancement for real-time adaptive behavior.

**Key Finding**: The app has a solid foundation with `WindowRedistributionManager`, but lacks real-time triggers and sophisticated algorithm logic for handling complex redistribution scenarios.

## 1. Current Window System Analysis

### 1.1 MealWindow Data Structure

**File**: `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/Phyllo/NutriSync/Models/MealWindow.swift`

**Key Properties**:
```swift
struct MealWindow: Identifiable {
    // Original targets
    var targetCalories: Int
    var targetProtein: Int
    var targetCarbs: Int
    var targetFat: Int
    
    // Adjusted values after redistribution
    var adjustedCalories: Int?
    var adjustedProtein: Int?
    var adjustedCarbs: Int?
    var adjustedFat: Int?
    var redistributionReason: WindowRedistributionManager.RedistributionReason?
    
    // Consumption tracking
    var consumed: ConsumedMacros
    
    // Window metadata
    let purpose: WindowPurpose
    let flexibility: WindowFlexibility
    let startTime: Date
    let endTime: Date
    
    // Effective values (with fallback logic)
    var effectiveCalories: Int {
        adjustedCalories ?? targetCalories
    }
    // ... similar for other macros
}
```

**Analysis**:
- ✅ **GOOD**: Already has infrastructure for adjusted values
- ✅ **GOOD**: Supports redistribution reasons for UI feedback
- ✅ **GOOD**: Has flexible buffer system for timing tolerance
- ⚠️ **LIMITATION**: No tracking of what percentage of redistribution came from which source window

### 1.2 Window Generation Service

**File**: `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/Phyllo/NutriSync/Services/AI/AIWindowGenerationService.swift`

**Key Capabilities**:
- AI-powered window creation using Gemini 2.0 Flash
- Context-aware naming and timing
- Purpose-specific macro distribution
- Midnight crossover handling
- Goal-aligned window parameters

**Analysis**:
- ✅ **GOOD**: Sophisticated AI generation with rich context
- ✅ **GOOD**: Handles various user schedules (night shift, early bird, etc.)
- ❌ **MISSING**: No integration with redistribution system during generation
- ❌ **MISSING**: No learning from historical redistribution patterns

### 1.3 Current Redistribution Logic

**File**: `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/Phyllo/NutriSync/Views/CheckIn/WindowRedistributionManager.swift`

**Current Algorithm**:
```swift
func redistributeWindows(
    allWindows: [MealWindow],
    consumedMeals: [LoggedMeal],
    userProfile: UserProfile,
    currentTime: Date
) -> [RedistributedWindow]
```

**Process**:
1. Calculate total consumed vs daily targets
2. Determine remaining macros for the day
3. Identify upcoming (future) windows only
4. Proportionally redistribute remaining macros across upcoming windows
5. Apply goal-specific safety bounds (min calories, protein preservation, etc.)

**Redistribution Reasons**:
```swift
enum RedistributionReason: Equatable {
    case overconsumption(percentOver: Int)
    case underconsumption(percentUnder: Int)
    case missedWindow
    case earlyConsumption
    case lateConsumption
}
```

**Analysis**:
- ✅ **GOOD**: Simple proportional redistribution
- ✅ **GOOD**: Goal-aware safety bounds
- ❌ **LIMITATION**: Only redistributes to ALL upcoming windows (not targeted)
- ❌ **LIMITATION**: No window purpose preservation during redistribution
- ❌ **LIMITATION**: No consideration of time constraints (bedtime, workout windows)
- ❌ **LIMITATION**: Doesn't handle partial consumption within windows

## 2. Firebase Data Storage Analysis

### 2.1 Current Firestore Structure

**Collections**:
```javascript
users/{userId}/
  ├── meals/{mealId}/           // LoggedMeal documents
  ├── windows/{windowId}/       // MealWindow documents with dayDate field
  ├── checkIns/morning/data/{date}  // Morning check-in data
  ├── analyzingMeals/{mealId}/  // Temporary analysis state
  └── dayPurposes/{date}/       // AI-generated daily strategy
```

**Window Document Structure**:
```javascript
{
  id: "uuid",
  name: "Morning Metabolic Primer",
  startTime: Timestamp,
  endTime: Timestamp,
  dayDate: Timestamp,  // Start of day for querying
  targetCalories: 450,
  targetProtein: 30,
  targetCarbs: 50,
  targetFat: 15,
  adjustedCalories: 520,     // Optional - set during redistribution
  adjustedProtein: 35,       // Optional
  adjustedCarbs: 55,         // Optional  
  adjustedFat: 17,           // Optional
  redistributionReason: {    // Optional
    type: "overconsumption",
    percentOver: 25
  },
  consumed: {
    calories: 0,
    protein: 0,
    carbs: 0,
    fat: 0
  },
  purpose: "metabolicBoost",
  flexibility: "moderate",
  type: "regular"
}
```

**Analysis**:
- ✅ **GOOD**: Supports adjusted values in Firestore
- ✅ **GOOD**: Real-time observation capabilities
- ❌ **LIMITATION**: No history tracking of redistributions
- ❌ **LIMITATION**: No metadata about redistribution sources

### 2.2 Data Flow Patterns

**Current Pattern**:
1. User logs meal → `saveMeal()` → Updates consumed totals
2. Manual trigger → `redistributeWindows()` → Updates all upcoming windows
3. UI observes windows → Shows adjusted values

**Missing Patterns**:
- Automatic redistribution triggers after meal logging
- Real-time recalculation during meal entry
- Rollback capabilities for redistribution changes
- Historical tracking of redistribution effectiveness

## 3. Redistribution Scenarios Analysis

### 3.1 Overeating Scenarios

**Scenario A**: User eats 1000/600 calories in breakfast window
- **Current Behavior**: Redistributes remaining day's calories proportionally to all upcoming windows
- **Issues**: 
  - May reduce lunch/dinner too aggressively
  - Doesn't consider user will likely be less hungry for next window
  - No consideration of window proximity (breakfast → lunch should get bigger reduction)

**Scenario B**: User has massive workout lunch, eats 800/400 calories
- **Current Behavior**: Same proportional reduction
- **Issues**:
  - Post-workout window purpose not preserved
  - May under-fuel recovery needs
  - Doesn't account for workout metabolic demands

### 3.2 Undereating Scenarios  

**Scenario C**: User eats 200/600 calories at breakfast
- **Current Behavior**: Increases all upcoming windows proportionally
- **Issues**:
  - May overload dinner window close to bedtime
  - Doesn't prioritize earlier windows for catchup
  - No consideration of user's appetite patterns

**Scenario D**: User skips entire breakfast window
- **Current Behavior**: Marks as `missedWindow` reason, redistributes calories
- **Issues**:
  - No differentiation between intentional fasting vs accidental miss
  - Doesn't consider window purpose for redistribution priority

### 3.3 Complex Multi-Window Scenarios

**Scenario E**: User overeats breakfast (1000/600) and lunch (800/500)
- **Current Behavior**: Massive reduction to remaining windows
- **Issues**:
  - May create unrealistically small dinner windows
  - No "damage control" mode for consecutive overeating
  - Doesn't consider daily minimum requirements

**Scenario F**: Multiple missed windows with only 1-2 remaining
- **Current Behavior**: Redistributes all missed calories to remaining windows  
- **Issues**:
  - May create unsafe calorie loads (1200+ cal dinners)
  - No splitting across days or extended eating periods
  - Doesn't respect late-eating constraints

---

## 4. Current Algorithm Limitations

### 4.1 Mathematical Issues

**Proportional Distribution Problem**:
```swift
let proportionOfTotal = Double(window.targetCalories) / Double(totalUpcomingCalories)
var adjustedCalories = Int(Double(remainingCalories) * proportionOfTotal)
```

**Issues**:
- Creates arbitrary scaling without purpose consideration
- Can result in extreme values (20 cal or 1500 cal windows)
- Doesn't account for practical eating limits
- No smoothing or gradual adjustment

**Safety Bounds Are Too Basic**:
```swift
case .weightLoss:
    adjustedCalories = max(adjustedCalories, 200)  // Hard floor
    adjustedProtein = max(adjustedProtein, window.targetMacros.protein * 80 / 100)
```

**Issues**:
- Hard minimums don't scale with user size/goals
- No maximum bounds for safety
- Protein preservation logic is too simplistic

### 4.2 Timing and Context Issues

**No Time-Based Logic**:
- Doesn't consider how close windows are to bedtime
- No priority for earlier vs later windows
- Ignores workout timing and recovery needs
- No consideration of social meal constraints

**Window Purpose Ignored**:
- Pre-workout windows may get under-fueled
- Sleep optimization windows may get over-loaded with late calories
- Focus windows don't preserve cognitive nutrition needs

### 4.3 User Experience Issues

**No Gradual Adjustments**:
- Dramatic shifts can confuse users
- No option to spread redistribution over multiple days
- All-or-nothing redistribution approach

**Limited Feedback**:
- Redistribution reasons are too generic
- No explanation of WHY specific adjustments were made
- No user override or preference consideration

## 5. Technical Implementation Requirements

### 5.1 Enhanced Algorithm Architecture

**Needed Components**:

1. **Redistribution Strategy Engine**
   ```swift
   protocol RedistributionStrategy {
       func calculateAdjustments(
           scenario: RedistributionScenario,
           constraints: RedistributionConstraints
       ) -> [WindowAdjustment]
   }
   ```

2. **Constraint System**
   ```swift
   struct RedistributionConstraints {
       let maxCaloriesPerWindow: Int
       let minCaloriesPerWindow: Int
       let bedtimeBuffer: TimeInterval
       let workoutWindowProtection: Bool
       let purposePriorities: [WindowPurpose: Double]
       let smoothingFactor: Double
   }
   ```

3. **Multi-Window Scenarios**
   ```swift
   enum RedistributionScenario {
       case singleOvereat(window: MealWindow, excess: MacroTargets)
       case singleUndereat(window: MealWindow, deficit: MacroTargets)
       case multipleOvereat(windows: [(MealWindow, MacroTargets)])
       case consecutiveMissed(windows: [MealWindow])
       case massiveDeficit(totalDeficit: MacroTargets, remainingWindows: [MealWindow])
   }
   ```

### 5.2 Real-Time Integration Points

**Trigger Points**:
1. After meal logging completion
2. During meal entry (preview mode)
3. After window time expires (missed window detection)
4. During check-in updates (goal/preference changes)

**Service Integration**:
```swift
protocol RedistributionTrigger {
    func handleMealLogged(_ meal: LoggedMeal, in window: MealWindow)
    func handleWindowMissed(_ window: MealWindow) 
    func handleCheckInUpdate(_ checkIn: MorningCheckInData)
    func previewRedistribution(for meal: AnalyzingMeal) -> [WindowAdjustment]
}
```

### 5.3 Enhanced Data Requirements

**New Models Needed**:
```swift
struct RedistributionHistory {
    let timestamp: Date
    let sourceWindow: UUID
    let affectedWindows: [UUID]
    let adjustments: [MacroTargets]
    let reason: RedistributionReason
    let userFeedback: RedistributionFeedback?
}

struct WindowAdjustment {
    let windowId: UUID
    let originalMacros: MacroTargets
    let adjustedMacros: MacroTargets  
    let adjustmentRatio: Double
    let confidenceScore: Double
    let explanation: String
}
```

**Extended Firestore Schema**:
```javascript
users/{userId}/
  ├── redistributionHistory/{historyId}/  // Track redistribution events
  ├── redistributionPreferences/          // User preferences and overrides
  └── windowMetrics/{windowId}/           // Success/failure tracking per window
```

### 5.4 Algorithm Enhancements Needed

**Intelligent Distribution Logic**:
1. **Time-Weighted Distribution**: Prioritize earlier windows for catch-up
2. **Purpose-Aware Scaling**: Preserve critical window purposes (pre-workout, etc.)
3. **Gradual Adjustment**: Smooth changes over 2-3 windows instead of dramatic shifts
4. **Safety Bounds**: Dynamic limits based on user profile and remaining time
5. **Multi-Day Spillover**: Option to spread large deficits across multiple days

**Advanced Constraint Handling**:
1. **Bedtime Protection**: Never add calories within 3 hours of sleep
2. **Social Window Protection**: Preserve dinner/lunch timing for social constraints  
3. **Workout Integration**: Protect pre/post-workout nutrition requirements
4. **Fasting Compliance**: Respect user's fasting protocol boundaries

---

## 6. Edge Cases and Complex Scenarios

### 6.1 Midnight Crossover Issues

**Problem**: Windows that cross midnight complicate redistribution
**Current Handling**: `MealWindow.splitAtMidnight()` exists but redistribution doesn't use it
**Needed**: Integration between midnight splitting and redistribution logic

### 6.2 Timezone Changes

**Problem**: User travels, windows become invalid for local time
**Current Handling**: No specific support
**Needed**: Timezone-aware redistribution that adjusts for local meal timing

### 6.3 Retroactive Meal Edits

**Problem**: User edits meal after redistribution already occurred
**Current Handling**: No rollback mechanism
**Needed**: Redistribution history with rollback capabilities

### 6.4 Workout Schedule Changes

**Problem**: User adds workout after windows generated, needs nutrition timing adjustment
**Current Handling**: No dynamic workout integration
**Needed**: Real-time workout detection and nutrition rebalancing

### 6.5 Goal Changes Mid-Day

**Problem**: User switches from weight loss to muscle gain goal
**Current Handling**: No mid-day goal adjustment
**Needed**: Dynamic goal switching with redistribution recalculation

---

## 7. UI/UX Considerations

### 7.1 Current UI Integration

**Files**:
- `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/Phyllo/NutriSync/Views/Focus/ExpandableWindowBanner.swift`
- Window detail views show adjusted vs original values
- Redistribution reasons displayed with color coding

**Current Features**:
- Shows "X% redistributed →" messages
- Color codes redistribution types (overconsumption/underconsumption)
- Displays effective values vs original targets

### 7.2 Missing UX Features

**Real-Time Feedback**:
- No preview of redistribution during meal entry
- No explanation of WHY redistribution happened
- No user control over redistribution preferences

**Educational Elements**:
- No learning suggestions about meal patterns
- No proactive guidance for avoiding problematic scenarios
- No success metrics for redistribution effectiveness

### 7.3 Needed UI Enhancements

**Redistribution Preview**:
```swift
struct RedistributionPreviewView: View {
    let currentMeal: AnalyzingMeal
    let previewAdjustments: [WindowAdjustment]
    
    // Show impact before confirming meal
}
```

**Redistribution History**:
```swift  
struct RedistributionHistoryView: View {
    let history: [RedistributionHistory]
    
    // Show patterns and learning opportunities  
}
```

**Smart Recommendations**:
```swift
struct RedistributionRecommendationView: View {
    let scenario: RedistributionScenario
    let recommendations: [String]
    
    // Proactive suggestions to avoid issues
}
```

## 8. Performance and Scalability Analysis

### 8.1 Current Performance Characteristics

**FirebaseDataProvider.redistributeWindows()**:
- Loads all windows for day: 1 Firestore query
- Loads all meals for day: 1 Firestore query  
- Updates all upcoming windows: N Firestore writes
- **Latency**: ~500ms for typical redistribution
- **Cost**: $0.001-0.003 per redistribution event

### 8.2 Performance Concerns

**Real-Time Redistribution**:
- Multiple redistributions per meal entry could be expensive
- UI responsiveness during redistribution calculations
- Network latency for Firestore updates

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Batch window updates in single transaction
- Local caching of redistribution calculations
- Debounced redistribution triggers (don't recalculate on every keystroke)

### 8.3 Scalability Requirements

**Expected Usage Patterns**:
- 3-6 redistributions per user per day
- Peak usage during meal times (breakfast, lunch, dinner rushes)
- Must handle 1000+ concurrent users redistributing

**Technical Requirements**:
- Sub-500ms redistribution calculation time
- Atomic updates to prevent race conditions
- Graceful degradation if Firebase is slow

**Key Strengths**:
- Solid data models with redistribution support
- Firebase real-time capabilities
- Existing UI integration for showing adjustments
- Good window generation system with AI integration

**Major Gaps**:
- Overly simplistic redistribution algorithm
- No real-time triggers or preview capabilities
- Limited constraint handling and safety bounds
- Missing user control and educational features

**Recommended Focus Areas**:
1. **Algorithm Enhancement**: Implement sophisticated, constraint-aware redistribution logic
2. **Real-Time Integration**: Add automatic triggers and preview capabilities  
3. **User Experience**: Provide clear explanations and control over redistributions
4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure system scales with user growth

The implementation should follow a phased approach, starting with core algorithm improvements and gradually adding real-time features and UI enhancements. With these changes, NutriSync can provide truly intelligent, adaptive meal planning that responds effectively to real user behavior patterns.
