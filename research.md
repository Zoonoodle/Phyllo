## Context Engineering - Research Phase

Last Updated: 2025-08-29

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** This is a TEMPLATE file. For actual work, create `research-[feature-name].md`

---

## 📋 MANDATORY WORKFLOW NOTICE

**This research MUST be the FIRST step for ALL development:**
1. Agent 1: Deep analysis → Creates `research-[feature].md`
2. Agent 2: Reads research → Creates `plan-[feature].md`
3. Agent 3+: Executes plan systematically

**NEVER skip research phase. ALWAYS scan entire codebase thoroughly.**

See `CONTEXT-ENGINEERING-WORKFLOW.md` for full protocol.
