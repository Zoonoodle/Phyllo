## üöÄ **Phyllo's Core Innovation**

Phyllo evolves beyond PlateUp by becoming a **proactive health optimization platform** that:
- Predicts and prevents energy crashes before they happen
- Provides real-time meal recommendations based on current context
- Offers voice-first interaction with minimal UI friction
- Integrates with wearables for comprehensive health insights
- Learns from global patterns while maintaining privacy

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Development Workflow (MUST FOLLOW)**

### **Mandatory Build Testing**
Whenever you add or change ANY code:
1. ALWAYS run `xcodebuild` to ensure the project builds successfully
2. Make sure its Iphone 16 pro simulator, NOT iphone 15
2. If `xcodebuild` fails, try `swift build` as a fallback
3. For long builds, save the build output to a log file and read it:
   ```bash
   xcodebuild > build_log.txt 2>&1
   # Then read build_log.txt to check for errors
   ```
4. NEVER commit or finish a task without confirming the build succeeds
5. Fix ALL build errors before marking any task as complete
