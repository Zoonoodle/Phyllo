## üöÄ **Current Implementation Overview**

Phyllo is a nutrition tracking app built around **meal windows** - smart eating periods optimized for your goals. The app uses a timeline-based interface to visualize when you should eat throughout the day, with proactive nudges to keep you on track.

### **Core Features Implemented**

1. **Timeline-Based Schedule View** - Visual meal window management
2. **Comprehensive Check-In System** - Morning and post-meal tracking
3. **Smart Nudge System** - Proactive coaching and reminders
4. **Advanced Meal Analysis** - Photo capture with detailed nutrition breakdown
5. **Momentum Analytics** - Progress tracking and insights with PhylloScore
6. **Developer Dashboard** - Mock data management for testing
7. **Micronutrient Intelligence** - 18+ tracked micronutrients with smart evaluation
8. **Ingredient Tracking** - Full ingredient breakdown with food group categorization
9. **Health Impact Petals** - Visual micronutrient health impact system

## üõ†Ô∏è **Development Workflow (MUST FOLLOW)**

### **Mandatory Build Testing**
Whenever you add or change ANY code:
1. ALWAYS run `xcodebuild` to ensure the project builds successfully
2. Make sure its iPhone 16 Pro simulator, NOT iPhone 15
3. If `xcodebuild` fails, try `swift build` as a fallback
4. For long builds, save the build output to a log file and read it:
   ```bash
   xcodebuild > build_log.txt 2>&1
   # Then read build_log.txt to check for errors
   ```
5. NEVER commit or finish a task without confirming the build succeeds
6. Fix ALL build errors before marking any task as complete
7. **ALWAYS delete build logs after reading them** - Clean up build_log.txt and any other temporary build files immediately after fixing errors or confirming build success

### **Simplified Git Workflow**

#### **Commit-Only Strategy**
Since you're working solo and reviewing all changes, we use a simplified workflow:
- Work directly on main branch
- Claude Code ALWAYS commits after completing any feature/fix
- Clear, descriptive commit messages
- No branches, no PRs, no issues

#### **Commit Message Format**
```
feat: Add new feature
fix: Fix bug  
refactor: Restructure code
docs: Update documentation
style: Format code
test: Add tests
chore: Update dependencies
```

#### **Claude Code Auto-Commit Rules**

1. **After Every Feature/Fix:**
   - Run xcodebuild to ensure it builds
   - Commit ALL changes with descriptive message
   - Push to GitHub automatically

2. **Commit Examples:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add morning check-in nudge"
   git commit -m "fix: correct meal window timing calculation"
   git commit -m "refactor: simplify timeline view structure"
   ```

## üèóÔ∏è **Current Architecture**

### **Navigation Structure (3 Tabs)**

#### **1. Schedule Tab (Focus)**
- **Timeline View**: Hour-by-hour view from 7 AM to 10 PM
- **Meal Windows**: Visual blocks showing eating periods
- **Current Time Marker**: Real-time position indicator
- **Meal Logging**: Shows meals within their assigned windows
- **Window Details**: Tap to expand and see window-specific nutrition targets

#### **2. Momentum Tab**
- **4-Card Grid Layout**:
  - PhylloScore (overall nutrition score)
  - Social Leaderboard
  - Metrics & Goal Progress
  - Weekly Momentum Trends
- **Detailed Views**: Each card expands to full analytics

#### **3. Scan Tab**
- **Camera Preview**: Full-screen capture interface

     - Health impact visualization

---

## üì± **Key Components**

### **Meal Windows System**

```swift
struct MealWindow {
    // Time-based eating periods with purpose
    let startTime: Date
    let endTime: Date
    let purpose: WindowPurpose // pre-workout, post-workout, sustained energy, etc.
    let targetCalories: Int
    let targetMacros: MacroTargets
    let flexibility: WindowFlexibility // strict, moderate, flexible
}
```

**Window Generation Logic**:
- Adapts to user goals (weight loss = 16:8 fasting)
- Circadian optimization (last meal 3 hours before sleep)
- Workout-aware scheduling
- Dynamic redistribution when windows are missed

### **Check-In System**

**Morning Check-In**:
- Wake time capture
- Sleep quality (1-5 scale with emojis)
- Daily focus selection (work, fitness, family, etc.)
- Triggers meal window generation

**Post-Meal Check-Ins**:
- Energy levels (5 levels with colors)
- Fullness scale (visual indicators)
- Mood/focus tracking
- Appears 30 minutes after meal logging

### **Nudge System**

```swift
enum NudgeType {
    case morningCheckIn           // Prompts morning routine
    case activeWindowReminder     // "15 minutes left in lunch window"
    case missedWindow            // "You missed your snack window"
    case mealCelebration         // Positive reinforcement
    case firstTimeTutorial       // Onboarding guidance
}
```

**Nudge Behavior**:
- Priority-based queuing
- Smart timing (no nudges during sleep hours)
- Dismissible with memory
- Context-aware messaging

### **Mock Data System**

Developer dashboard allows:
- Time simulation (jump to any time of day)
- Instant meal generation with ingredients and micronutrients
- Goal switching
- Window redistribution testing
- Check-in completion
- Micronutrient data generation based on meal type

### **Micronutrient Tracking System**

**Core Features**:
- 18+ micronutrients tracked with RDA values
- Window-aware evaluation (e.g., iron for energy windows, magnesium for sleep)
- Health impact scoring (0-10 scale)
- Visual petal system showing nutrient impacts on:
  - Energy levels
  - Sleep quality
  - Focus & cognition
  - Recovery
  - Immune function

**Implementation**:
```swift
struct MicronutrientInfo {
    let name: String
    let dailyTarget: Double
    let unit: String // mg, Œºg, g
    let healthImpacts: [HealthCategory: Double] // 0-10 scale
    let icon: String // SF Symbol
}
```

### **Ingredient Tracking**

**Food Group System**:
- 8 food groups with color coding
- Ingredient-level nutrition data
- Visual chips in meal analysis
- Nutrition breakdown by ingredient

**Implementation**:
```swift
struct MealIngredient {
    let name: String
    let quantity: Double
    let unit: String
    let foodGroup: FoodGroup
    // Optional nutrition per ingredient
    var calories: Int?
    var protein: Double?
    var carbs: Double?
    var fat: Double?
}
```

### **Meal Analysis View**

**Three-Tab Interface**:
1. **Nutrition Tab**:
   - Calorie and macro overview
   - Scrollable micronutrient list with progress bars
   - Daily progress tracking
   - Color-coded by nutrient type

2. **Ingredients Tab**:
   - Color-coded ingredient chips
   - Horizontal scroll of nutrition cards
   - Food group categorization
   - Portion sizes and units

3. **Insights Tab**:
   - Window-specific micronutrient focus
   - AI-generated meal insights
   - Health impact visualization
   - Contextual recommendations
