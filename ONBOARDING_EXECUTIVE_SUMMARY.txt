ANALYZER: Claude Code AI
CODEBASE VERSION: Main branch (latest)

================================================================================
OVERALL STATUS: 85/100 - FUNCTIONALLY COMPLETE MVP, NEEDS REFINEMENT
================================================================================

KEY FINDINGS:

✅ Excellent state persistence - users can resume interrupted sessions
✅ 29 screens implemented (18-24 shown depending on goal selection)
✅ Account creation options working (Apple Sign In, Email Sign Up)
✅ Profile data collection 76% complete

⚠️ 4 critical data fields missing (name, height, email storage, error handling)
⚠️ Goal preference screens implemented but disabled (needs uncomment)
⚠️ Error handling weak in completion phase
⚠️ Data validation insufficient on numeric inputs
❌ No offline support
❌ No analytics tracking

================================================================================

Overall: 26/34 fields (76% complete)

================================================================================
FLOW VERIFICATION (END-TO-END)
================================================================================

✅ App launch → Anonymous auth
✅ Check for existing profile

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

FOR IMMEDIATE LAUNCH:
1. Collect name field (critical UX)
2. Handle window generation errors (blocking issue)
3. Collect height field (calculation accuracy)
4. Add data validation ranges (data quality)

FOR POST-LAUNCH V1.1:
1. Re-enable goal preference screens (personalization)
2. Save email from account creation (feature enabler)
3. Improve error messages (UX polish)
4. Fix GetStartedView state (UX friction)

FOR OPTIMIZATION:
1. Implement offline queuing (reliability)
2. Add analytics events (measurement)
3. Compress section intros (UX speed)
4. Add tutorial overlays (guidance)

================================================================================
KEY METRICS TO TRACK POST-LAUNCH
================================================================================

- Completion rate: % of users who finish onboarding
- Avg time to complete: How long does onboarding take?
- Dropout rate per screen: Where do users abandon?
- Account creation success rate: How many upgrade from anonymous?
- Window generation errors: How often does AI service fail?
- Resume success rate: How many can resume after interruption?

================================================================================
RISK ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

HIGH RISK (could block launch):
- Window generation error handling
- Name/height missing from collected data
- Email not saved (blocks email features)

MEDIUM RISK (should be fixed before wider rollout):
- Goal preference screens disabled
- Weak data validation
- GetStartedView state management
- No offline support

LOW RISK (polish items):
- Redundant section intros
- Generic error messages
- No analytics tracking

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

NutriSync's onboarding is ARCHITECTURALLY SOUND with excellent state 
persistence and a clear user journey. The implementation is 85% complete 
and suitable for MVP launch with the critical issues addressed.

READY FOR LAUNCH: With fixes to data collection gaps and error handling
READY FOR WIDE RELEASE: After addressing high-priority issues and testing

Most impactful improvements would be:
1. Enable goal preference screens (personalization)
2. Fix data collection gaps (name, height, email)
3. Handle completion errors (reliability)

Recommend 1-2 person team working 2 weeks on critical issues before wider
launch, followed by iterative improvements based on user feedback.
