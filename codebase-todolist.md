## üìä Progress Metrics

**Total Tasks:** 11
**Completed:** 5
**In Progress:** 1
**Not Started:** 5
**Completion Rate:** 45%

## üöÄ Next Up Queue

1. Complete SimplePerformanceView implementation
2. Begin Firebase Migration Sprint
3. Implement real-time meal window redistribution

## üìù Context Engineering Protocol

### MANDATORY Workflow for ALL Tasks:

1. **RESEARCH PHASE** (Agent 1)
   - Deep codebase analysis
   - Create `research-[feature-name].md`
   - Thorough pattern discovery
   
2. **PLANNING PHASE** (Agent 2)
   - Read research document
   - Create `plan-[feature-name].md`
   - Get human clarification
   
3. **IMPLEMENTATION PHASE** (Agent 3+)
   - Execute plan systematically
   - Monitor context usage (stop at 40% remaining)
   - Create `progress-[feature-name].md` when needed
   
4. **CONTINUATION LOOP**
   - New agent reads progress + plans
   - Continue implementation
   - Repeat until complete
   
5. **REVIEW & CLEANUP**
   - User testing and verification
   - Delete temporary .md files
   - Update this todolist

## üé® Development Guidelines

- **ALWAYS** follow Context Engineering Protocol
- **NEVER** skip research phase
- **COMPILE** before every commit
- **TEST** edge cases thoroughly
- **DOCUMENT** decisions in appropriate .md files
