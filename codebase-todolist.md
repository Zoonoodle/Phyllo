## üé® Design & Development Guidelines

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Design Decision Protocol
- **ALL UI/UX changes REQUIRE user approval FIRST**
- **NEVER make autonomous design decisions**
- **ALWAYS present mockups/suggestions for confirmation**
- **User input weighs MORE HEAVILY than AI suggestions**
- **Document all design decisions in research/plan phases**

### Technical Guidelines

- **ALWAYS** follow Context Engineering Protocol
- **NEVER** skip research phase
- **COMPILE** before every commit
- **TEST** edge cases thoroughly
- **DOCUMENT** decisions in appropriate .md files
