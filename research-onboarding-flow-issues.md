# NutriSync Onboarding Flow Issues - Comprehensive Research Analysis

## Executive Summary

This research analysis examines critical issues in the NutriSync iOS app's onboarding flow that affect user goal selection, target weight collection, and rate selection logic. The issues stem from hardcoded screen flow sequences and inadequate conditional navigation based on user goal selection.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Goal Selection Recognition Issue

**Problem**: App only recognizes "Lose Weight" regardless of user selection
**Root Cause**: Goal mapping inconsistencies and hardcoded flow navigation

**Current Implementation Analysis**:
- **File**: `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/Phyllo/NutriSync/Views/Onboarding/NutriSyncOnboarding/GoalSelectionView.swift`
- **Goal Options Available**:
  ```swift
  let goals = [
      ("Lose Weight", "arrow.down.circle.fill", "Reduce body weight sustainably", Color.red),
      ("Maintain Weight", "equal.circle.fill", "Keep your current weight steady", Color.blue),
      ("Gain Weight", "arrow.up.circle.fill", "Build muscle or increase weight", Color.green)
  ]
  ```
- **Goal Setting**: Line 81 - `coordinator.goal = selectedGoal`

**Data Flow Issues**:
- Goals are stored as string values in the coordinator
- String mapping occurs in `buildUserProfile()` and `buildUserGoals()` methods
- Mapping logic in `OnboardingCoordinator.swift` (lines 302-315, 345-352):
  ```swift
  let nutritionGoal: NutritionGoal = switch goal.lowercased() {
      case "lose weight", "weight loss": .weightLoss(...)
      case "build muscle", "muscle gain": .muscleGain(...)
      case "maintain weight": .maintainWeight
      case "improve performance", "performance": .performanceFocus
      case "better sleep": .betterSleep
      default: .overallHealth
  }
  ```

**Issue**: The "Gain Weight" string doesn't match any case in the switch statement, defaulting to `.overallHealth`

### 2. Target Weight Screen Problems

**Problem**: Slider functionality issues and missing conditional logic
**File**: `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/Phyllo/NutriSync/Views/Onboarding/NutriSyncOnboarding/TargetWeightView.swift`

**Current Implementation Analysis**:
- **WeightRulerSlider Implementation** (lines 141-266):
  - Complex drag gesture handling with offset calculations
  - Haptic feedback system
  - Unit conversion between lbs/kg
  - Reference weight hardcoded at line 207-208: `let referenceWeight = unit == "lbs" ? 163.0 : 74.0`

**Issues Identified**:
1. **Drag Sensitivity**: Complex offset calculations may cause responsiveness issues
2. **Missing Visual Indicator**: No clear display of weight difference from current weight
3. **Hardcoded Reference**: Current weight should come from coordinator, not hardcoded values
4. **No Goal-Based Logic**: Screen always shows regardless of goal selection

### 3. Maintain Weight Logic Issue

**Problem**: Users selecting "maintain weight" still asked for target weight
**Root Cause**: Static screen flow definition

**Flow Analysis**:
- **File**: `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/Phyllo/NutriSync/Views/Onboarding/NutriSyncOnboarding/OnboardingSectionData.swift`
- **Goal Setting Section Flow** (lines 68-75):
  ```swift
  .goalSetting: [
      "Goal Intro",
      "Goal Selection", 
      "Target Weight",      // ← Always shown regardless of goal
      "Weight Loss Rate",   // ← Always shown regardless of goal
      "Pre-Workout Nutrition",
      "Post-Workout Nutrition"
  ]
  ```

**Issue**: No conditional screen flow based on selected goal. All users see Target Weight and Weight Loss Rate screens.

### 4. Rate Selection Screen Issues

**Problem**: Only designed for weight loss, not weight gain
**File**: `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/Phyllo/NutriSync/Views/Onboarding/NutriSyncOnboarding/WeightLossRateView.swift`

**Current Implementation Analysis**:
- **Screen Title**: "At what rate?" (line 91)
- **Subtitle**: "Set your desired rate of weight loss." (line 99) - Hardcoded for weight loss
- **Rate Options** (lines 17-22):
  ```swift
  let rateOptions = [
      (label: "Conservative", rate: 0.25, color: Color.blue),
      (label: "Standard", rate: 0.5, color: Color.green),
      (label: "Aggressive", rate: 0.75, color: Color.orange),
      (label: "Extreme", rate: 1.0, color: Color.red)
  ]
  ```
- **Calculations**: All oriented toward weight loss (deficit calculations)
- **Display Text**: Lines 190-201 show "−X.X lbs" (negative values only)

**Issues**:
1. **Language**: Screen text assumes weight loss
2. **Calculations**: Deficit-only calculations, no surplus logic for weight gain
3. **Visual Design**: Color scheme implies "faster = more dangerous" which doesn't apply to weight gain
4. **Button Text**: "Done with goal" (line 266) - Generic but context unclear

## Data Model Analysis

### Goal Representation Issues

**Current Models**:
1. **UserGoals.Goal enum** (`/Users/brennenprice/Documents/Phyllo/NutriSync/Models/UserGoals.swift`):
   ```swift
   enum Goal: String, CaseIterable, Codable {
       case loseWeight = "Weight Loss"
       case buildMuscle = "Build Muscle"  // ← Note: Different from "Gain Weight"
       case maintainWeight = "Maintain Weight"
       case improvePerformance = "Performance"
       case betterSleep = "Better Sleep"
       case overallHealth = "Overall Health"
   }
   ```

2. **Legacy NutritionGoal enum** (lines 104-236): More comprehensive with parameters

**Mapping Problems**:
- UI shows "Gain Weight" but model has "Build Muscle"
- String matching in switch statements fails for "Gain Weight"
- No consistent mapping between UI strings and enum values

### OnboardingProgress Model

**File**: `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/Phyllo/NutriSync/Models/OnboardingProgress.swift`
**Stores**: All onboarding data including `primaryGoal`, `targetWeightKG`, `weeklyWeightChangeKG`
**Issue**: No validation that target weight is required only for certain goals

## Navigation Flow Analysis

### Current Coordinator Logic

**File**: `/Users/brennenprice/Documents/Phyllo/NutriSync/Views/Onboarding/NutriSyncOnboarding/OnboardingCoordinator.swift`

**Navigation Methods**:
- `nextScreen()` (lines 110-119): Simple linear progression
- `previousScreen()` (lines 121-138): Reverse navigation
- No conditional logic based on goal selection

**Screen Rendering** (lines 460-551):
- Uses static screen name lookup
- No dynamic flow based on user data
- All screens in goalSetting section always shown

## Recommendations for Fixes

### 1. Goal Selection Fix
- Update string mapping in switch statements to include "Gain Weight" → "Build Muscle"
- Create consistent mapping between UI strings and model enums
- Add validation for goal selection

### 2. Conditional Navigation Implementation
- Modify `nextScreen()` to skip inappropriate screens based on goal
- For "Maintain Weight": Skip "Target Weight" and "Weight Loss Rate" screens
- For "Gain Weight": Show modified rate screen for weight gain

### 3. Target Weight Screen Improvements
- Fix WeightRulerSlider sensitivity issues
- Add visual weight difference indicator
- Use coordinator.weight instead of hardcoded reference
- Make screen conditional based on goal

### 4. Rate Selection Screen Enhancements
- Create goal-aware screen titles and descriptions
- Implement weight gain calculations (surplus instead of deficit)
- Adjust color scheme and language for different goals
- Add separate logic for gain vs. loss rates

### 5. Data Flow Improvements
- Implement goal-based screen filtering in OnboardingSectionData
- Add validation in OnboardingProgress model
- Create goal-specific validation rules
