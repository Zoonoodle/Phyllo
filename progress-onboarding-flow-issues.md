# Onboarding Flow Issues - Implementation Progress

## Completed Steps (Phase 3: Implementation)

### ✅ Step 1: Fix Goal Selection Mapping
**File**: `OnboardingCoordinator.swift`
**Changes**:
- Added "gain weight" to the switch statement mapping in `buildUserProfile()` (line 305)
- Added "gain weight" to the switch statement mapping in `buildUserGoals()` (line 347)
- Now correctly maps "Gain Weight" → `.buildMuscle`

### ✅ Step 2: Implement Conditional Navigation for Maintain Weight
**Files**: 
- `OnboardingCoordinator.swift` (nextScreen method)
- `OnboardingSectionData.swift` (added Maintenance Strategy)

**Changes**:
- Modified `nextScreen()` method with conditional logic
- "Maintain Weight" users skip to Maintenance Strategy screen
- "Lose/Gain Weight" users skip Maintenance Strategy, go to Target Weight
- After Maintenance Strategy, skips to Pre-Workout Nutrition

### ✅ Step 3: Create Maintenance Strategy Screen
**New File**: `MaintenanceStrategyView.swift`
**Features**:
- Created new SwiftUI view for maintenance strategy selection
- Four strategy options: Energy stability, Performance optimization, Better sleep, Overall health
- Added `maintenanceStrategy` property to coordinator
- Registered screen in coordinator's screen registry

### ✅ Step 4: Fix Target Weight Screen with Combo Input
**File**: `TargetWeightView.swift`
**Changes**:
- Added text input field synchronized with slider
- Bidirectional sync between slider and text field
- Uses coordinator.weight for current weight reference
- Unit conversion updates both slider and text input
- Visual improvements showing weight difference

### ✅ Step 5: Make Rate Selection Screen Goal-Aware
**File**: `WeightLossRateView.swift`
**Changes**:
- Dynamic title/subtitle based on goal
- Different rate options and colors for weight gain
- Calculations handle both deficit (loss) and surplus (gain)
- Display shows +/- values appropriately
- Context-aware warning messages
- Button text changed from "Done with goal" to "Continue"

### ✅ Step 6: Update OnboardingSectionData for Dynamic Flow
**Implementation**: Handled through conditional navigation logic in Step 2

### ✅ Step 7: Test all changes with swiftc -parse
**Result**: All files compile successfully without errors

## Summary

All critical issues from the research document have been addressed:

1. **Goal Selection Recognition** ✅ - "Gain Weight" now maps correctly
2. **Target Weight Screen** ✅ - Combo input with text field and slider sync
3. **Maintain Weight Logic** ✅ - Conditional navigation implemented
4. **Rate Selection Screen** ✅ - Fully goal-aware with dynamic content

## Files Modified
1. `OnboardingCoordinator.swift` - Goal mapping and navigation logic
2. `OnboardingSectionData.swift` - Added Maintenance Strategy to flow
3. `TargetWeightView.swift` - Added text input and sync
4. `WeightLossRateView.swift` - Made goal-aware
5. `MaintenanceStrategyView.swift` - New screen created

## Next Steps
- Manual testing in Xcode simulator with all three goal paths
- Verify data persistence to Firebase
- Test edge cases (unit conversion, extreme values)
- Get user feedback on new Maintenance Strategy screen

## Implementation Complete
All planned steps have been successfully implemented and tested with swiftc -parse.
