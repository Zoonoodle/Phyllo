### Design Tools & Workflow

**Design Phase (Figma/Illustrator):**
1. Create all static assets at 1920×1080 (or 1080×1920 for vertical version)
2. Use brand colors: #C0FF73 (lime green), #0a0a0a (black), #FFFFFF (white)
3. Export as layered PSDs or individual PNGs with alpha
4. Organize files: `graphics/animation-name/layers/`

**Animation Phase (After Effects):**
1. Import layered assets
2. Create compositions at 1920×1080, 24fps
3. Animate using keyframes + easing (F9)
4. Add sound effects for key moments (whoosh, pop, checkmark)
5. Preview render at half-res for review
6. Export:
   - Primary: H.264 with alpha (if needed)
   - Backup: ProRes 4444 (for re-editing)

**Alternative: Canva Pro (Simpler)**
- Use Canva's animation presets
- Limited control but faster

### Editing Phases

#### Phase 1: Assembly Cut (Day 3)
1. Import all footage
2. Sync audio (Pluraleyes or manual)
3. Select best A-roll takes
4. Rough cut following script
5. Target length: 5:30 (will trim to 5:00)

**Pacing Guide:**
- Act 1 (Problem): Quick cuts, urgency (2-3s per shot)
- Act 2 (Discovery): Medium pace, let science breathe (4-5s)
- Act 3 (Building): Montage energy (2s cuts)
- Act 4 (Features): Demo pace, clear (5-8s per feature)
- Act 5 (Proof): Authority, hold longer (4-6s)
- Act 6 (Personal): Intimate, fewer cuts (6-8s)
- Act 7 (CTA): Clear, direct (5s)

#### Phase 2: B-Roll Integration (Day 3-4)
1. Place B-roll on V3-V4 tracks
2. Use J-cuts and L-cuts for smooth transitions
3. Match B-roll to narration keywords
4. Add screen recordings at appropriate moments
5. Ensure no "dead air" (something visually interesting every second)

**Transition Guide:**
- Primary: Straight cuts (90% of edits)
- Occasional: 0.2s cross dissolve for smooth transitions
- Avoid: Fancy wipes, slides (feels dated)

#### Phase 3: Graphics & Animation (Day 4)
1. Import all After Effects animations
2. Place on V6 track
3. Adjust timing to match narration
4. Add blend modes if needed (Screen, Multiply)
5. Ensure graphics don't overlap confusingly

#### Phase 4: Text Overlays & Captions (Day 4)
**Auto-Captioning:**
1. Window → Text → Transcribe Sequence
2. Wait for AI processing (5-10 min for 5-min video)
3. Review transcript, fix errors
4. Create Captions from Transcript
5. Style captions:
   ```
   Font: SF Pro Display Bold
   Size: 48pt
   Color: White
   Stroke: 5px black
   Background: None (or subtle black box at 20% opacity)
   Position: Lower third
   Animation: Fade in 0.15s, fade out 0.15s
   Max width: 80% of frame
   ```

**Manual Text Overlays:**
- Use Essential Graphics panel
- Key phrases: Lime green (#C0FF73) background highlight
- Timing: Sync precisely with narration emphasis
- Animation: Simple fade or slide, nothing distracting

#### Phase 5: Music & Sound Design (Day 5)
**Music Selection:**
- Instrumental, no vocals
- Builds and releases match video arc
- Layers: Intro (subtle) → Build (Acts 2-4) → Emotional (Act 6) → Confident (Act 7)
- Source: Epidemic Sound, Artlist, or Musicbed

**Music Mix:**
```
Intro (0:00-0:50): -26dB (ambient, tense)
Discovery (0:50-1:40): Fade up to -22dB (building curiosity)
Building (1:40-2:30): -20dB (energy, momentum)
Features (2:30-3:45): -22dB (under narration, supportive)
Proof (3:45-4:20): -20dB (authority, confidence)
Personal (4:20-4:40): -24dB (intimate, pull back)
CTA (4:40-5:00): -18dB (confident, inviting)
```

**Sound Effects:**
- Whoosh: Transitions between acts (-18dB)
- Pop: Graphics appearing (-20dB)
- UI sounds: Taps, swipes in screen recordings (-22dB)
- Checkmark: Satisfying confirmation sound (-16dB)
- Camera shutter: Photo capture moments (-18dB)
- Typing: Subtle during coding B-roll (-26dB)

**Voiceover Processing (A1):**
```
1. Normalize: -6dB
2. EQ:
   - High-pass: 80Hz (remove rumble)
   - Boost: +3dB at 200Hz (warmth)
   - Cut: -4dB at 400Hz (remove mud)
   - Boost: +2dB at 3kHz (clarity)
   - Cut: -2dB at 6-8kHz if sibilance is harsh
3. Compression:
   - Ratio: 3:1
   - Threshold: -12dB
   - Attack: 10ms
   - Release: 100ms
   - Makeup Gain: +3dB
4. DeEsser (if needed):
   - Frequency: 6-8kHz
   - Reduction: 4-6dB
5. Final Normalize: -3dB peak
```

**Music Ducking:**
- Automated: Music drops -8dB when narration plays
- Method 1: Sidechain compression (music compressed by VO track)
- Method 2: Manual keyframes (more control)

#### Phase 6: Color Grading (Day 5)
**Step 1: Adjustment Layer (V7)**
Apply to entire timeline:
```
Lumetri Color - Basic Correction:
- Temperature: +5 (warmer)
- Tint: -2
- Exposure: +0.2
- Contrast: +10
- Highlights: -10 (recover blown areas)
- Shadows: +15 (lift darkness)
- Whites: +5
- Blacks: -5

Lumetri Color - Creative:
- Look: Teal & Orange LUT at 30% (optional)
- Saturation: +5 (slightly more vibrant)
```

**Step 2: B-Roll Specific Grading**
Frustration clips (Act 1):
```
- Desaturate: -40%
- Exposure: -0.1 (slightly darker)
- Contrast: +15 (harsh)
```

Discovery/Building clips (Acts 2-3):
```
- Saturation: Normal
- Slight blue tint (focus, concentration)
```

Results/Success clips (Act 5-7):
```
- Saturation: +10
- Exposure: +0.1 (brighter)
- Warmth: +10 (optimistic)
```

**Step 3: Selective Color - Isolate Lime Green**
```
Lumetri Color - HSL Secondary:
1. Key out lime green range:
   - Hue: 80-120
   - Saturation: 30-80
   - Luma: 40-100
2. Refine: Denoise, Blur edges
3. Color Wheels (Correction):
   - Saturation: +50 (boost ONLY green)
   - Midtones: Slight lift
Result: Lime green pops, rest of image stays balanced
```

**Step 4: Vignette**
```
Effect: Lumetri Color - Vignette
- Amount: -0.15 (subtle)
- Midpoint: 50%
- Roundness: 70%
- Feather: 50%
```

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Issue: Audio has echo/reverb
**Solution:**
- Record in smaller room with soft surfaces (carpet, curtains, furniture)
- Add blankets/pillows around recording area to absorb sound
- Use iZotope RX or Adobe Audition's DeReverb tool
- Re-record in better environment if unusable

#### Issue: Footage looks too dark
**Solution:**
- Increase exposure in Lumetri Color (+0.5 to +1.0 stops)
- Lift shadows and blacks
- Add gain to highlights
- Use Curves for more precise control
- Last resort: Denoise (but image quality will suffer)

#### Issue: Graphics look pixelated or low-quality
**Solution:**
- Ensure graphics exported at full resolution (1920×1080)
- Check sequence settings match source resolution
- Use "Maximum Render Quality" on export
- Avoid scaling graphics beyond 100% in timeline
- Re-export graphics at higher bitrate (ProRes instead of H.264)

#### Issue: Video exceeds 5:00 target length
**Solution:**
- Trim B-roll clips (3s → 2s)
- Speed up footage by 10% (barely noticeable, saves 30s)
- Remove least essential feature (keep strongest 5 of 6)
- Tighten narration pauses
- Cut redundant shots

#### Issue: Music competes with voiceover
**Solution:**
- Lower music to -24dB or below during narration
- Use EQ to cut music's mid-range (500Hz-2kHz) where voice sits
- Apply sidechain compression (music ducks automatically with voice)
- Choose music without busy mid-range frequencies

#### Issue: Color inconsistent between shots
**Solution:**
- Use Color Match tool in Premiere (match to reference shot)
- Apply same adjustment layer to all shots from same location
- Use Lumetri presets as starting point
- White balance correction: Use eyedropper on neutral gray
- Manual adjustment: Match highlights, then midtones, then shadows

#### Issue: Export file too large for upload
**Solution:**
- Lower bitrate (15 Mbps → 10 Mbps)
- Use H.264 instead of ProRes for uploads
- Reduce audio bitrate (320 kbps → 192 kbps)
- Check for accidental high frame rate (60fps → 24fps)
- Use HandBrake for additional compression

## Final Notes & Strategy

### Key Success Principles

**1. Authenticity Over Polish**
- Your genuine story as a student/developer is your biggest asset
- Don't try to sound like a corporate marketing video
- Show the messy reality: failures, late nights, uncertainty
- Vulnerability creates connection

**2. Education First, Product Second**
- Teach meal timing science BEFORE pitching NutriSync
- Viewers remember lessons, not sales pitches
- Position yourself as educator, not salesperson
- The product becomes the natural solution to the problem you explained

**3. Visual Storytelling**
- One good animation explains more than 100 words
- Show, don't tell (especially for app features)
- Use metaphors: dominos for momentum, clock for timing
- Lime green (#C0FF73) is your signature - use it purposefully

**4. Respect the Viewer's Time**
- Every second must earn its place in the video
- If a shot doesn't add value, cut it
- Fast-paced but not rushed
- 5 minutes should feel like 3

**5. Call to Action is an Invitation, Not Pressure**
- "Try it for a week" is less intimidating than "Buy now"
- Low-commitment ask ("just 3 meals") increases conversion
- Share your journey, let viewers decide to join
- Confidence without arrogance
