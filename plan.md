## 🎯 Feature/Fix Overview

**Title:** [Feature/Fix Name]
**Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Estimated Sessions:** [1-3]
**Research Basis:** `research.md` dated [YYYY-MM-DD]

---

## 📋 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: [Setup/Preparation]
**Files to Modify:**
- [ ] `path/to/file1.swift`
- [ ] `path/to/file2.swift`

**Actions:**
1. [Specific action]
2. [Specific action]

**Test Command:**
```bash
swiftc -parse -sdk $(xcrun --sdk iphonesimulator --show-sdk-path) \
  -target arm64-apple-ios17.0 file1.swift file2.swift
```

---

### Step 2: [Core Implementation]
**Files to Modify:**
- [ ] `path/to/file3.swift`

**Code Changes:**
```swift
// Specific code to add/modify
// With exact location context
```

**Validation:**
- [ ] Compiles without errors
- [ ] Follows existing patterns
- [ ] Handles edge cases

---

### Step 3: [Integration]
**Files to Modify:**
- [ ] `path/to/file4.swift`

**Dependencies:**
- Requires Step 1 & 2 complete
- Check [specific integration point]

---

### Step 4: [Testing & Cleanup]
**Test Scenarios:**
1. [Normal case]
2. [Edge case 1]
3. [Edge case 2]

**Cleanup:**
- [ ] Remove debug code
- [ ] Update comments
- [ ] Check for unused imports

## 🚨 Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues
1. **Issue:** [What could go wrong]
   **Mitigation:** [How to handle]

2. **Issue:** [What could go wrong]
   **Mitigation:** [How to handle]

### Rollback Plan
```bash
# If something breaks:
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push --force  # Only if already pushed
```

## ✅ Completion Checklist

### Pre-Implementation
- [ ] Research completed and documented
- [ ] Plan reviewed and approved
- [ ] Current work committed and pushed
- [ ] Fresh context window (<40% usage)

### During Implementation
- [ ] Follow step order strictly
- [ ] Test after each step
- [ ] Commit working increments
- [ ] Update progress.md as needed

### Post-Implementation
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Code follows conventions
- [ ] Changes committed and pushed
- [ ] Progress.md updated with completion

---

## 📊 Success Criteria

- [ ] Feature works as specified
- [ ] No regression in existing features
- [ ] Performance targets met
- [ ] Code maintainable and clear

---

## 🔄 Session Handoff

**If context window fills:**
1. Complete current step
2. Commit any working code
3. Update this plan with progress
4. Start new session with: "Continue plan.md Step [X]"

**Key Context to Preserve:**
- [Critical decision made]
- [Important constraint discovered]
- [Pattern to maintain]
