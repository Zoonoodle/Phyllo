# Progress: Morning Check-In Redesign Implementation
*Created: 2025-08-30*
*Phase 3: Implementation - Partial Completion*

## Summary
Successfully implemented the morning check-in redesign using onboarding patterns. All screens have been converted to the V2 template pattern with standardized navigation and visual consistency.

## Completed Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Foundation Components (COMPLETE)
- Created `OnboardingHeader.swift` - Standardized header with progress bar
- Created `OnboardingNavigation.swift` - Bottom navigation with back/next buttons
- Created `CheckInScreenTemplate.swift` - Template wrapper for all screens
- Created `MorningCheckInViewModel.swift` - Observable ViewModel pattern
- Imported and adapted ProgressBar from onboarding
- All foundation components compile successfully

### ✅ Step 2: Simple Screen Conversions (COMPLETE)
- Created `WakeTimeSelectionViewV2.swift` - Time grid selection preserved
- Created `PlannedBedtimeViewV2.swift` - Time picker with sleep duration
- Both screens compile and integrate with ViewModel

### ✅ Step 3: Slider Screen Conversions (COMPLETE)
- Created `SleepQualityViewV2.swift` - Simplified without moon phases
- Created `EnergyLevelViewV2.swift` - Slider-based energy selection
- Created `HungerLevelViewV2.swift` - Slider-based hunger selection
- All slider screens compile successfully

### ✅ Step 4: Complex Screen Conversions (COMPLETE)
- Created `ActivitiesViewV2.swift` - Full activity planning with dietary restrictions
- Created `DayFocusViewV2.swift` - Multi-select focus areas
- Complex data binding to ViewModel properties works correctly

### ✅ Step 5: Coordinator & Integration (COMPLETE)
- Created `MorningCheckInCoordinator.swift` - Main flow coordinator
- Updated references in `NudgeContainer.swift` to use new coordinator
- Updated references in `AIScheduleView.swift` to use new coordinator
- Full system compiles successfully with all V2 screens

## Files Modified
- `NudgeContainer.swift` - Updated to use MorningCheckInCoordinator
- `AIScheduleView.swift` - Updated to use MorningCheckInCoordinator

## Remaining Tasks

### 🔄 Cleanup Phase (Not Started)
The following old files need to be deleted after user verification:

**Check-In Screens to Delete:**
- `MorningCheckInView.swift` (old coordinator)
- `WakeTimeSelectionView.swift`
- `SleepQualityView.swift`
- `EnergyLevelSelectionView.swift`
- `HungerLevelSelectionView.swift`
- `EnhancedActivitiesView.swift`
- `DayFocusSelectionView.swift`
- `PlannedBedtimeView.swift`
- `PlannedActivitiesView.swift` (legacy version)

**Components to Delete:**
- `CheckInButton.swift` (replaced by OnboardingNavigation)
- `CheckInProgressBar.swift` (replaced by ProgressBar)
- `CheckInSliderViews.swift` (no longer needed)
- `SleepHoursSlider.swift` (simplified to standard slider)
- `SleepVisualizations.swift` (moon phases removed)
- `CoffeeSteamAnimation.swift` (animations simplified)

## Technical Notes

### Screen Order in Coordinator
1. Wake Time Selection (Step 0)
2. Sleep Quality (Step 1)
3. Energy Level (Step 2)
4. Hunger Level (Step 3)
5. Day Focus (Step 4)
6. Activities Planning (Step 5)
7. Planned Bedtime (Step 6)

### Data Flow
- All screens use `@Bindable var viewModel: MorningCheckInViewModel`
- Data persists through navigation via shared ViewModel
- CheckInManager integration maintained in `saveCheckIn()`
- Window generation triggers after completion

### Visual Consistency Achieved
- ✅ Progress bar visible on all screens
- ✅ Standardized headers with consistent typography
- ✅ Bottom navigation matches onboarding exactly
- ✅ Simplified animations per user request
- ✅ Template pattern ensures consistency

## Testing Status
- ✅ Foundation components compile
- ✅ Simple screens compile
- ✅ Slider screens compile
- ✅ Complex screens compile
- ✅ Full coordinator compiles
- ✅ Updated references compile
- ⏳ Manual UI testing in Xcode pending
- ⏳ User verification pending

## Next Actions for Continuation
1. **User Verification**: Have user test the new flow in Xcode
2. **Cleanup**: Delete old files after user confirms new flow works
3. **Git Commit**: Commit all changes with appropriate message
4. **Update Documentation**: Update any relevant documentation

## Context Usage Note
Implementation completed successfully within context limits. Ready for user testing and cleanup phase.
