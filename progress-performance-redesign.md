# Progress: Performance Tab Redesign Implementation

## Current Status
âœ… ALL PHASES COMPLETE (Steps 1-20 of 20)
ðŸ“… Last Updated: 2025-09-07

## Exact Stopping Point
- **Phase**: Phase 4 Complete - IMPLEMENTATION FINISHED  
- **Next Step**: Ready for user testing and review
- **File**: All components created and integrated
- **Context Usage**: Implementation complete with context to spare

## Completed Steps (âœ…)

### Phase 1: Design Token Foundation
1. âœ… Created PerformanceDesignSystem.swift with design tokens
2. âœ… Updated NutritionDashboardView structure - removed tabs and view selector
3. âœ… Analyzed and documented calculation issues with inline TODOs
4. âœ… Created base PerformanceCard component
5. âœ… Tested Phase 1 changes compilation - SUCCESS

### Phase 2: Hero Component Replacement
6. âœ… Created PerformancePillarCard component
7. âœ… Created Hero section layout with three cards (Timing, Nutrients, Adherence)
8. âœ… Removed AppleStyleRing dependencies and related functions
9. âœ… Implemented calculation fixes in NutritionDashboardView:
   - **Timing**: More forgiving (0-30min: 85%, 30-60min: 70%, 60min+: 50%)
   - **Nutrients**: Added leniency factor for active windows
   - **Adherence**: Only counts required windows (>200 cal or main meals)
10. âœ… Tested Phase 2 changes compilation - SUCCESS

## Files Modified
- `NutriSync/Views/Momentum/PerformanceDesignSystem.swift` (created)
- `NutriSync/Views/Momentum/Components/PerformanceCard.swift` (created)
- `NutriSync/Views/Momentum/Components/PerformancePillarCard.swift` (created with animations)
- `NutriSync/Views/Momentum/Components/CurrentWindowCard.swift` (created)
- `NutriSync/Views/Momentum/Components/NextWindowCard.swift` (created)
- `NutriSync/Views/Momentum/Components/InsightCard.swift` (created)
- `NutriSync/Views/Momentum/NutritionDashboardView.swift` (heavily modified, integrated new components)

## Critical Context
1. **Design System**: Successfully implemented shadcn-inspired design tokens
2. **Tab Removal**: Completely removed the tab system, now single scrollable view
3. **Hero Replacement**: Three mini-cards replaced the tri-color ring successfully
4. **Calculation Issues**: âœ… FIXED:
   - Timing score now more forgiving with gradual penalties
   - Nutrient score accounts for active windows with leniency factor
   - Adherence only counts required meal windows (excludes optional snacks)

## Remaining Work (Steps 11-20)

### Phase 3: Card System Unification (Steps 11-15)
- âœ… Step 11: Created CurrentWindowCard component
- âœ… Step 12: Created NextWindowCard component
- âœ… Step 13: Created InsightCard component
- âœ… Step 14: Removed Streak/Fasting components from UI
- âœ… Step 15: Tested Phase 3 changes - SUCCESS

### Phase 4: Copy & Polish (Steps 16-20)
- âœ… Step 16: Updated microcopy with contextual messages
- âœ… Step 17: Implemented loading states with shimmering effect
- âœ… Step 18: Added subtle spring animations to all cards:
  - Hero cards animate on value changes
  - Window cards slide in from top
  - Insight card scales in subtly
- âœ… Step 19: Final layout assembly with new card integration
- âœ… Step 20: Final compilation test - SUCCESS

## Next Actions
âœ… ALL IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE!

Ready for:
1. User testing and feedback
2. Performance verification in Xcode
3. Final adjustments based on user preferences
4. Calculation fixes can be done in next session if needed

## Notes
- Compilation tests passing for all changes
- Design system successfully adopted from Schedule tab
- Hero component transformation complete
- Need to continue with remaining card components for full unification
