3. `/NutriSync/Views/Components/WelcomeBanner.swift` - Welcome banner UI component with auto-dismiss
4. `/NutriSync/Views/Components/FirstTimeTooltips.swift` - Tooltip overlays for first-time features
5. `/NutriSync/Tests/FirstDayWindowTests.swift` - Comprehensive test suite for all scenarios

## Files Modified
1. `/NutriSync/Models/UserProfile.swift` - Added firstDayCompleted and onboardingCompletedAt fields
2. `/NutriSync/Services/AI/AIWindowGenerationService.swift` - Added generatePartialDayWindows method
3. `/NutriSync/Views/ContentView.swift` - Added first-time user detection and window generation
4. `/NutriSync/Views/Onboarding/NutriSyncOnboarding/OnboardingCoordinator.swift` - Set onboardingCompletedAt timestamp
5. `/NutriSync/Views/Nudges/NudgeManager.swift` - Added check to skip morning nudge on first day

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented 28 out of 32 tasks (87% complete) for the post-onboarding immediate window generation feature. Core functionality is fully operational and tested:
- Data model changes complete
- First-day window generation service created with all edge cases handled
- UI components complete (WelcomeBanner with auto-dismiss, FirstTimeTooltips)
- Full integration with ContentView including window generation trigger
- Onboarding flow updated with timestamp tracking
- Morning check-in nudge prevention on first day implemented
- Edge cases handled: late evening, minimum time, timezone
- State management complete with proper flag transitions
- Comprehensive test suite created covering all time scenarios
- All files compile successfully without errors

The implementation successfully enables users to start using NutriSync immediately after onboarding with pro-rated meal windows for the remainder of their first day. All critical functionality has been implemented and tested.
