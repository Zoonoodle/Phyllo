2. `/NutriSync/Services/FirstDayWindowService.swift` - Service for generating first-day windows
3. `/NutriSync/Views/Components/WelcomeBanner.swift` - Welcome banner UI component

## Files Modified
1. `/NutriSync/Models/UserProfile.swift` - Added firstDayCompleted and onboardingCompletedAt fields
2. `/NutriSync/Services/AI/AIWindowGenerationService.swift` - Added generatePartialDayWindows method
3. `/NutriSync/Views/ContentView.swift` - Added first-time user detection and window generation
4. `/NutriSync/Views/Onboarding/NutriSyncOnboarding/OnboardingCoordinator.swift` - Set onboardingCompletedAt timestamp
5. `/NutriSync/Views/Nudges/NudgeManager.swift` - Added check to skip morning nudge on first day

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented 21 out of 32 tasks (65% complete) for the post-onboarding immediate window generation feature. Core functionality is fully operational:
- Data model changes complete
- First-day window generation service created with all edge cases handled
- UI components ready (WelcomeBanner created)
- Full integration with ContentView including window generation trigger
- Onboarding flow updated with timestamp tracking
- Morning check-in nudge prevention on first day implemented
- Edge cases handled: late evening, minimum time, timezone
- State management complete with proper flag transitions

The implementation successfully enables users to start using NutriSync immediately after onboarding with pro-rated meal windows for the remainder of their first day.
