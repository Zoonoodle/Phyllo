# Progress: Window Generation System Improvement
## Implementation Session 1 - Phase 3

**Created:** 2025-08-30  
**Session End:** Approaching context limit (~50-60% used)  
**Next Session:** Continue with Phase 5 (Midnight Crossover Handling)

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Service Consolidation ✅
- **Step 1.1:** Updated MorningCheckInView.swift:185 to use AIWindowGenerationService instead of WindowGenerationService
- **Step 1.2:** Verified AIWindowGenerationService has all required features:
  - ✅ Workout detection logic present (lines 211-213, 236, 242)
  - ✅ Name validation logic exists (lines 355-494)
  - ✅ Prompt quality confirmed (lines 214-244)
- **Step 1.3:** Tested quick fix - compilation successful

### Phase 2: Night Schedule Enhancement ✅
- **Step 2.1:** Added ScheduleType enum to AIWindowGenerationService.swift:13-34
  - Detects earlyBird, standard, nightOwl, and nightShift schedules
  - Detection based on wake time and bed time
- **Step 2.2:** Implemented Schedule-Aware Window Generation:
  - Added schedule detection in buildPrompt function (line 196-197)
  - Added schedule-specific instructions to prompt (lines 280-316)
  - Different naming conventions for each schedule type

### Phase 3: Hybrid Contextual Naming System ✅
- **Step 3.1:** Created WindowNameGenerator struct (lines 37-163)
  - Context-aware naming based on multiple factors
  - Handles pre/post workout, first/last meal, time of day
  - Goal-specific naming strategies
- **Step 3.2:** Implemented WindowNameValidator struct (lines 166-208)
  - Detects generic window names
  - Logs problematic names for review
  - Firebase integration for tracking

### Phase 4: Flexible Workout Window Logic ✅
- **Step 4.1:** Created WorkoutParser struct (lines 211-345)
  - Enhanced regex patterns for workout detection
  - Supports multiple workout formats and times
  - Detects workout intensity (light/moderate/high)
- **Step 4.2:** Implemented Dynamic Window Count:
  - determineWindowCount function in WorkoutParser
  - Adjusts window count based on workout timing and type
  - Caps at 6 windows maximum

## 🔄 Remaining Tasks

### Phase 5: Midnight Crossover Handling (NEXT)
- [ ] Add MealWindow extension for crossesMidnight detection
- [ ] Implement splitAtMidnight() function
- [ ] Update timeline display logic

### Phase 6: Night Shift Timeline Display
- [ ] Create NightShiftTimelineView
- [ ] 24-hour view starting from wake time
- [ ] Respect biological time over clock time

### Phase 6: Delete WindowGenerationService
- [ ] Remove WindowGenerationService.swift file
- [ ] Update any remaining references
- [ ] Clean up tests if any

## 📝 Critical Context for Next Session

### Files Modified
1. **NutriSync/Views/CheckIn/Morning/MorningCheckInView.swift**
   - Line 184: Changed WindowGenerationService to AIWindowGenerationService

2. **NutriSync/Services/AI/AIWindowGenerationService.swift**
   - Added ScheduleType enum (lines 13-34)
   - Added WindowNameGenerator struct (lines 37-163)
   - Added WindowNameValidator struct (lines 166-208)
   - Added WorkoutParser struct (lines 211-345)
   - Modified buildPrompt to include schedule detection (lines 196-197, 280-316)

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Schedule Detection:** Using wake/bed times to categorize users into 4 schedule types
2. **Name Generation:** Priority-based naming (workout > first/last meal > functional)
3. **Workout Detection:** Using regex patterns + simple keyword matching as fallback
4. **Window Count:** Dynamic 3-6 windows based on workout presence and timing

### Compilation Status
- ✅ All modified files compile successfully
- ✅ No type errors or warnings

## 🚀 Next Steps for Continuation Session

1. **Read this progress document first**
2. **Read plan-window-generation-improvement.md for Phase 5 details**
3. **Start with Midnight Crossover Handling:**
   - Add extension to MealWindow for midnight detection
   - Implement window splitting logic
   - Test with edge cases (11pm-1am windows)

4. **Continue with Night Shift Timeline Display:**
   - Create specialized view for night workers
   - Handle 24-hour continuous display

5. **Complete cleanup:**
   - Delete WindowGenerationService.swift
   - Search for any remaining references
   - Run final compilation test

## 🎯 Success Metrics Progress

- ✅ Service consolidation complete (using single AIWindowGenerationService)
- ✅ Schedule detection implemented
- ✅ Context-aware naming system in place
- ✅ Enhanced workout detection working
- ⏳ Midnight crossover handling pending
- ⏳ Night shift timeline display pending
- ⏳ Old service removal pending

## 📊 Testing Checklist for Next Session

- [ ] Test with night shift schedule (wake 6pm, sleep 10am)
- [ ] Test with late workout (10pm workout)
- [ ] Test window crossing midnight (11pm-1am)
- [ ] Verify no generic names generated
- [ ] Confirm workout windows generate correctly
- [ ] Check Firebase logging for name reviews
