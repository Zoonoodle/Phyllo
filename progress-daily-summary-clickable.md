## ✅ Completed Tasks

### Phase A: Backend & Data ✅
1. **Extended AI Window Generation Service** ✅
   - Added `DayPurpose` struct with comprehensive day strategy fields
   - Modified `generateWindows()` to return tuple of windows and day purpose
   - Updated prompt to request day purpose generation
   - Made DayPurpose public for use across the app

2. **Updated Data Models** ✅
   - Added DayPurpose structure to AIWindowGenerationService
   - Added `currentDayPurpose` property to FirebaseDataProvider
   - Updated all call sites to handle tuple return value

3. **Created Daily Aggregation Functions** ✅
   - Added `aggregateDailyNutrition()` for daily totals
   - Added `calculateMicronutrientStatus()` for deficient/excess nutrients
   - Added `getDailyFoodTimeline()` for chronological food list
   - Created supporting structures (DailyNutritionSummary, MicronutrientStatus, TimelineEntry)

### Phase B: Core UI ✅
4. **Added Tap Gesture to MacroSummaryBar** ✅
   - Added `showDayDetail` binding to DayNavigationHeader
   - Added tap gesture with haptic feedback
   - Added chevron indicator for tappability
   - Updated AIScheduleView with showDayDetail state

5. **Created DayDetailView** ✅
   - Progressive loading structure implemented
   - Basic stats immediate display
   - Async load for detailed sections
   - Added sheet presentation in AIScheduleView
   - Created placeholder components for all sections

### Phase C: Components ✅
6. **Created DayPurposeCard** ✅
   - Expandable sections for each focus area
   - Displays nutritional strategy, energy management, performance optimization, recovery focus
   - Shows key priorities list
   - Clean card design with phylloCard background

7. **Created DailyNutriSyncRing** ✅
   - Reuses existing MacroNutritionPage design
   - Full day aggregation
   - Animated ring on appearance
   - Shows daily totals and window completion status

8. **Created MicronutrientStatusView** ✅
   - Shows only deficient/excess nutrients (max 8)
   - Color coding: Red (deficient), Orange (excess)
   - Expandable rows with actionable recommendations
   - Success state when all nutrients optimal

9. **Created ChronologicalFoodList** ✅
   - Timeline view with timestamps
   - Grouped by hour for readability
   - Lazy loaded meal photos
   - Shows window name and macro summary

### Phase D: Polish ✅
10. **Updated Morning Check-in Flow** ✅
    - FirebaseDataProvider now saves day purpose to Firestore
    - Added `getDayPurpose()` function for retrieval
    - Stores in `dayPurposes` collection with date key
    - Handles backwards compatibility

11. **Tested Complete Implementation** ✅
    - All files compile successfully
    - No syntax or type errors
    - Ready for manual testing in Xcode

## 🎯 Ready for Phase 5: Review & Cleanup

### Implementation Complete! Next Steps:

1. **User Testing Required**
   - Build and run in Xcode simulator
   - Test tap gesture on MacroSummaryBar
   - Verify sheet presentation and dismissal
   - Test progressive loading performance
   - Check data accuracy for daily aggregation
   - Verify day purpose generation after morning check-in

2. **Cleanup Tasks (Phase 5)**
   - Delete temporary markdown files (research, plan, progress)
   - Update codebase-todolist.md
   - Final commit with all changes
   - Push to repository

3. **Manual Testing Checklist**
   - [ ] Tap gesture responds with haptic feedback
   - [ ] Sheet presents smoothly
   - [ ] Basic data loads immediately (<0.5s)
   - [ ] Detailed sections load progressively
   - [ ] Micronutrients show only deficient/excess
   - [ ] Foods display chronologically
   - [ ] Day purpose shows all 4 focus areas
   - [ ] Dismiss gesture works properly
   - [ ] Memory usage stays reasonable
   - [ ] Works with empty state (no meals)
