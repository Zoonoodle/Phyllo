### [0:10-0:45] YOUR STORY - FAST VERSION
**FILMING:** A-roll (you talking) with B-roll overlays

**YOU:**
*"I'm Brennen. I'm a developer. And for years I had this problem: I'd crash hard at 3pm—like, couldn't function without a nap. Then I couldn't fall asleep at night. And I was eating a ton but couldn't gain weight.*

*I tried tracking everything in MyFitnessPal. Hit my calories, hit my macros. Nothing changed.*

*Then I found research on meal timing and scheduling; eating at the right TIMES with the right foods. I tried making a rough plan, stuck to it, and it wokred immediately. Energy crashes gone. Started sleeping. Finally gaining muscle.*

*But planning it took hours every week—calculating windows, planning meals, tracking everything. So I built this app to automate the entire system."*

#### **SECTION 1: Onboarding Walkthrough [0:45-2:00]**

**YOU (on camera, intro):**
*"So let's walk through the onboarding. I'm not going to explain every single screen, but I want to show you the main sections and what data we're collecting—because that's what makes the window generation actually work. The Goals section in particular is really interesting—I'll spend a bit more time there."*

**FILMING:**
- **A-ROLL:** You introducing this (7 seconds)
- **SCREEN RECORDING (68 seconds):** Full-screen phone recording showing the full onboarding flow

---

**[SCREEN: GetStarted / Welcome screens]**

**YOU (voiceover):**
*"First, there's a quick intro—explains the core concept. Meal windows, not meal tracking. Nothing fancy here."*

**FILMING NOTES:**
- Show GetStarted → Welcome screen transition (3-4 seconds)
- Keep it quick, don't linger

---

**[SCREEN: Basics section]**

**YOU (voiceover):**
*"Then we get into the Basics section. This is where the app collects  personal metrics including: age, height, weight, biological sex. This is used for calculating 1 baseline caloric needs and macro targets."*

**FILMING NOTES:**
- Show scrolling through Basics screens quickly (5-6 seconds)
- **GRAPHICS:** Highlight one or two fields (like "Weight" or "Age")
- Don't show every input, just the flow

---

**[SCREEN: Goals section - "Your Transformation"]**

**YOU (voiceover):**
*"Then we hit the Goals section—this is where it gets interesting. First, there's an intro screen about what optimizing meal timing can actually do for you."*

**FILMING NOTES:**
- Show "Your Transformation" intro screen briefly (2-3 seconds)
- Keep moving, don't linger

---

**[SCREEN: Specific Goals - Multi-Select Grid]**

**YOU (voiceover):**
*"Then you pick your goals. And here's the cool part—you can select multiple. Weight management, build muscle, steady energy, better sleep, athletic performance, metabolic health. Pick as many as you want."*

**FILMING NOTES:**
- Show the goal grid with all 6 options displayed as cards with SF Symbols
- Tap to select 2-3 goals (e.g., "Build Muscle & Recover" + "Steady Energy" + "Better Sleep")
- Show cards lighting up in lime green as selected
- **GRAPHICS:** Subtle zoom on each selected goal (6-8 seconds total)

---

**[SCREEN: Goal Ranking - The Priority Screen]**

**YOU (voiceover, excited - this is the key feature):**
*"Now here's where it gets really smart. If you picked multiple goals, it asks you to rank them by priority. Because realistically, you can't optimize for everything equally—so the app asks: what matters most to you?"*

**FILMING NOTES:**
- Show Goal Ranking screen with 3 ranked goals
- Demonstrate tapping up/down arrows to reorder goals (show actual reordering animation)
- **GRAPHICS:** Highlight the rank numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd) as you talk about priority
- Show the text: "We'll ask detailed questions" for top 2, "We'll use smart defaults" for 3rd+
- **PACING:** This is the most important part of Goals—spend 10-12 seconds here

**YOU (voiceover, continued):**
*"Your top two ranked goals get deep customization—detailed questions about preferences, timing, sensitivity. Goals ranked third or lower? The app uses smart defaults based on research. So you're not answering 50 questions, but you're still getting a personalized plan."*

---

**[SCREEN: Conditional Weight Goal Screens - QUICK]**

**YOU (voiceover):**
*"And if you selected Weight Management, it asks follow-up questions—lose, maintain, or gain, and by how much. Standard stuff."*

**FILMING NOTES:**
- Show weight goal selection screen quickly (3-4 seconds)
- Show weight target input screen (2-3 seconds)
- Don't dwell—this is less interesting than the ranking system

---

**[SCREEN: Schedule section]**

**YOU (voiceover):**
*"Then Schedule—this is the most important part. Wake time, sleep time, workout time. This is what the AI uses to actually build your windows. If you work out at 7am, your first window is pre-workout. If you sleep at 10:30pm, your last meal window ends at least 3 hours before that. This is where the magic happens."*

**FILMING NOTES:**
- Show wake time, sleep time, workout time selections (8-10 seconds)
- **GRAPHICS:** Highlight each time selection as you mention it
- Show workout time selection with options visible

---

**[SCREEN: Preferences section]**

**YOU (voiceover):**
*"Finally, Preferences. Dietary restrictions, allergies, foods you hate. This affects the food suggestions the app gives you later. If you're vegetarian, you're not getting chicken and rice suggestions. If you're lactose intolerant, no dairy."*

**FILMING NOTES:**
- Show Preferences screen, scroll through options (5-6 seconds)
- **GRAPHICS:** Highlight "Dietary Restrictions" section

---

**[SCREEN: Confirmation/Summary screen before AI generation]**

**YOU (voiceover):**
*"That's it. Five sections, maybe two minutes to complete. Now the app has everything it needs to generate your personalized meal windows."*

**FILMING NOTES:**
- Show final confirmation screen (2-3 seconds)
- Transition to next section with a tap on "Generate My Windows" button

---

#### **SECTION 2: Tech Stack Breakdown [2:00-2:45]**

**YOU (on camera, excited - this is for Congressional App Challenge judges):**
*"Alright, quick tech breakdown before we see the windows—because this is actually a pretty sophisticated stack."*

**FILMING:**
- **A-ROLL:** You on camera (4 seconds)
- Then cut to **B-ROLL** or **GRAPHICS** while you explain:

**YOU (voiceover):**
*"The entire app is built with SwiftUI—Apple's modern declarative UI framework. For local data persistence, I'm using SwiftData, which stores all your personal metrics, preferences, and meal logs directly on your device.*

*For cloud services, I'm using Firebase—specifically Firestore for cloud database sync, Firebase Auth for user accounts, and Firebase Storage for meal photos.*

*Authentication is flexible—you can sign in with Apple, Google, or email. I integrated Sign in with Apple and Google Sign-In for a seamless experience.*

*And for AI, I'm using Vertex AI from Google Cloud. That's what powers the meal window generation and the context-based food scanning. When you take a photo of your meal, the app sends the image plus your current window context to Vertex AI, which analyzes it and returns structured nutrition data.*

*So the architecture is: local-first with SwiftData for speed and privacy, Firebase for cloud sync and authentication, and Vertex AI for the intelligent features. Everything sensitive stays on your device unless you explicitly sync it."*

**FILMING NOTES:**
- **GRAPHICS/B-ROLL (45 seconds):**
  - [2:04] Text overlay: "Frontend: SwiftUI"
  - [2:08] Text overlay: "Local Storage: SwiftData"
  - [2:13] Text overlay: "Cloud: Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage)"
  - [2:19] Text overlay: "Authentication: Sign in with Apple + Google Sign-In"
  - [2:25] Text overlay: "AI/ML: Vertex AI (Google Cloud)"
  - [2:31] Architecture diagram showing: Device (SwiftData) ↔ Firebase ↔ Vertex AI
  - [2:38] Text overlay: "Privacy-First Architecture"
- **PACING:** Educational but not boring—keep energy up
- **SUBTITLES:** On voiceover (important for judges to catch all tech terms)

**YOU (on camera, quick):**
*"Modern stack, privacy-focused architecture. Now let's see what it generated."*

**FILMING:**
- **A-ROLL:** You on camera, transition line (2-3 seconds)

---

#### **SECTION 3: DailySync - Adaptive Context Input [2:45-3:20]**

**YOU (on camera, excited):**

- Mic pulsing, character count showing (315/500)

**YOU (voiceover, while screen recording plays):**
*"I'm telling it about my workout time, my school schedule, robotics practice. All the stuff that affects when I can actually eat. This isn't just 'when do you wake up'—it's understanding your entire day, in your own words."*

**FILMING NOTES:**
- **SCREEN RECORDING:** Show the full voice input, keep transcription readable
- **GRAPHICS:** Highlight key phrases as they appear ("working out at around one to 2 PM", "robotics", "school")

## 🎨 EDITING GUIDE

### Pacing:
- **0:00-0:45:** FAST cuts, high energy (cut every 3-5 seconds)
- **0:45-3:45:** MEDIUM pace, let screen recordings breathe (cut every 8-10 seconds)
- **3:45-5:00:** SLOW down, let message land (cut every 5-8 seconds)

### Subtitle Style:
- **Font:** Bold sans-serif (Montserrat or Bebas Neue)
- **Color:** White with black outline or black drop shadow
- **Position:** Lower third
- **Timing:** Word-by-word or phrase-by-phrase
- **Style:** YouTube-style (like MrBeast) - keeps attention

### Graphics/Overlays:
- **0:06:** Arrow pointing to phone screen
- **1:25:** Circles highlighting meal window times
- **2:50:** Macro breakdown zoom-in
- **3:15:** Checkmark animation on "Fits Target"
- **3:35:** Arrows showing macro redistribution
- **4:15:** Text: "WHEN > WHAT"
- **4:35:** QR code + TestFlight link

### Music:
- **0:00-0:45:** Upbeat, energetic (set the tone)
- **0:45-3:45:** Background, subtle (don't overpower voiceover)
- **3:45-5:00:** Slightly more inspirational (build to CTA)
- **Volume:** 10-15% max, ducked when you're talking

### Color Grading:
- Warm tones for A-roll (inviting)
- High contrast for B-roll (visual interest)
- Slight vignette on key moments (focus attention)
