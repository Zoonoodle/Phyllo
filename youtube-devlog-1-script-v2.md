### [0:10-0:45] YOUR STORY - FAST VERSION
**FILMING:** A-roll (you talking) with B-roll overlays

**YOU:**
*"I'm Brennen. I'm a developer. And for years I had this problem: I'd crash hard at 3pm‚Äîlike, couldn't function without a nap. Then I couldn't fall asleep at night. And I was eating a ton but couldn't gain weight.*

*I tried tracking everything in MyFitnessPal. Hit my calories, hit my macros. Nothing changed.*

*Then I found research on meal timing and scheduling; eating at the right TIMES with the right foods. I tried making a rough plan, stuck to it, and it wokred immediately. Energy crashes gone. Started sleeping. Finally gaining muscle.*

*But planning it took hours every week‚Äîcalculating windows, planning meals, tracking everything. So I built this app to automate the entire system."*

**FILMING INSTRUCTIONS:**
- **A-ROLL (Primary):** You at desk, casual, talking to camera
