**FILMING:** A-roll (you talking) → Quick cut to B-roll of app in use

**YOU (on camera, energetic):**

**FILMING INSTRUCTIONS:**
- **A-ROLL (0:00-0:06):** You talking directly to camera, holding phone showing NutriSync

### [0:10-0:45] YOUR STORY - FAST VERSION
**FILMING:** A-roll (you talking) with B-roll overlays

**YOU:**
*"I'm Brennen. I'm a developer. And for years I had this problem: I'd crash hard at 3pm—like, couldn't function without a nap. Then I couldn't fall asleep at night. And I was eating a ton but couldn't gain weight.*

*I tried tracking everything in MyFitnessPal. Hit my calories, hit my macros. Nothing changed.*

*Then I found research on meal timing and scheduling; eating at the right TIMES with the right foods. I tried making a rough plan, stuck to it, and it wokred immediately. Energy crashes gone. Started sleeping. Finally gaining muscle.*

*But planning it took hours every week—calculating windows, planning meals, tracking everything. So I built this app to automate the entire system."*

**FILMING INSTRUCTIONS:**
- **A-ROLL (Primary):** You at desk, casual, talking to camera
  - Shot 1: Medium shot (0:10-0:25)
  - Shot 2: Closer shot (0:25-0:35) - lean in when saying "worked immediately"

#### **SECTION 1: Onboarding [0:45-1:15]**

**YOU (on camera):**
*"When you first open it, it doesn't ask what you ate. It asks WHEN you live your life."*

**FILMING:**
- **A-ROLL:** You introducing this (5 seconds)
- **SCREEN RECORDING (25 seconds):** Full-screen phone recording showing:

🌅 Window 1: 7:00 AM - 8:00 AM
Purpose: Pre-Workout Energy
Target: 450 cal | 25g protein | 55g carbs

🏋️ Window 2: 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM
Purpose: Post-Workout Recovery

```

**YOU (on camera, pointing at screen):**
*"Notice the first window is right before my workout. Second is post-workout for recovery. And the last one is at 6:30pm—three hours before I sleep—so I can actually fall asleep. Every window has a purpose."*

- **SPLIT SCREEN:** Phone recording on left (60%), you on right (40%)
- **GRAPHICS:** Highlight each window as you talk about it

#### **SECTION 3: Food Suggestions [2:00-2:25]**

**FILMING NOTES:**
- **SCREEN RECORDING:** Show smooth scrolling through suggestions
- **GRAPHICS:** Highlight how suggestions match the macro targets

---

#### **SECTION 4: Using a Window [2:25-2:50]**

**FILMING:**

**FILMING:**
- **SCREEN RECORDING:** Scan tab camera interface
- **A-ROLL:** You taking photo of actual meal

**YOU (on camera):**
*"Here's where it gets interesting. Most AI food scanning is terrible—it guesses wildly. But this uses context-based scanning. It knows which window you're in, what macros you need, and analyzes the photo with that context. Way more accurate."*

**SCREEN RECORDING SHOWS:**
1. Tap "Log Meal" button
2. Camera opens (Scan tab)
3. Point at meal (show real meal on table)
4. Take photo
5. AI analyzing (loading animation with progress)

• 6oz grilled chicken breast
• 1 cup white rice
• Mixed vegetables
• Olive oil drizzle

Macros:
Calories: 580
Protein: 42g
Carbs: 68g
Fat: 12g

✅ Perfect for This Window
   (2g under protein, on target for carbs)

Confidence: 94%
```

**YOU (voiceover):**
*"See how it uses the window context? It knows I need 40g protein post-workout, so it analyzes the photo with that in mind. Way more accurate than generic AI scanning. Takes about 10 seconds. No manual entry."*

**FILMING NOTES:**
- **A-ROLL:** Actually take a photo of a real meal (prep this beforehand)
- **SCREEN RECORDING:** Show full process from camera → results
- **GRAPHICS:** Highlight the "Fits Your Window Target" checkmark
- **TIMING:** Show actual loading time (don't speed up) to prove it's fast

---

#### **SECTION 6: Adaptive Intelligence [3:30-3:45]**

**FILMING:**
- **SCREEN RECORDING:** Missing a window, redistribution animation

**YOU (voiceover):**
*"And if I miss a window? It automatically redistributes my macros to the remaining windows. So I'm still hitting my daily targets."*

**SCREEN RECORDING SHOWS:**
- Window 2 showing "Missed" in gray
- Remaining macros flowing to Windows 3 & 4 (animated)
- Updated targets appearing

**FILMING NOTES:**
- **SCREEN RECORDING:** Capture this redistribution animation (make it smooth)

**FILMING:** A-roll (you talking) with quick B-roll cuts

**YOU (on camera, direct):**

*If you get energy crashes in the afternoon—it's probably your meal timing.*

*If you can't fall asleep at night—you're eating too late.*

*If you're trying to gain muscle but it's not working—you're eating at the wrong times.*

*Every nutrition app makes you do the planning yourself. This automates the entire system—schedules your meals, suggests what to eat, and adapts to your life in real-time.*

*This is the app I wish existed when I was struggling. So I built it."*
