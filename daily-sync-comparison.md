## 🎬 User Journey Examples

### Example 1: Regular 9-5 Worker at 7am
**Current System**: 7 screens asking about sleep, mood, hunger, activities, etc.
**New System**: 3 screens - Schedule, Energy, Done!

### Example 2: Night Shift Nurse at 11pm  
**Current System**: "Morning check-in" makes no sense, skips it
**New System**: "Working tonight? Let's optimize your overnight nutrition" - Works perfectly!

### Example 3: Late Riser at 11am (already had breakfast)
**Current System**: No way to log eaten meal, generates full day including breakfast
**New System**: "Log what you've eaten" → Adjusts remaining meals perfectly

### Example 4: Traveler in Different Timezone
**Current System**: Confused by "morning" when it's evening locally
**New System**: Adapts to local time context automatically

## 🗑️ What We're Removing (and Why)

### ❌ Sleep Quality (1-10 scale)
**Why Remove**: Not directly actionable for meal timing. If tired, energy level captures this.

### ❌ Hunger Level (1-10 scale)
**Why Remove**: Changes every hour. Better to ask when scheduling next meal.

### ❌ Day Focus (12 options!)
**Why Remove**: Overwhelming choice paralysis. Work/workout schedule is sufficient.

### ❌ Morning Mood
**Why Remove**: Redundant with energy level, not nutrition-relevant.

### ❌ Window Preference 
**Why Remove**: AI should figure out optimal windows based on schedule.

### ❌ Planned Bedtime
**Why Remove**: Can infer from work schedule and meal timing goals.
