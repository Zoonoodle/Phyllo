# NutriSync "Day in the Life" Vlog Script
## 5-Minute Student Developer Vlog - Calm, Time-Structured Format

**Key Goal:** Subtly showcase NutriSync as productivity enabler throughout day
**Total Length:** 5:00 minutes

## 🎬 Production Notes

### Overall Vibe
- **Aesthetic:** Clean, minimal, intentional
- **Music:** Calm lo-fi/ambient (no lyrics) - consistent throughout
- **Pacing:** Steady, reflective, productive
- **Color Grading:** Slightly warm, natural, not overly saturated
- **Audio:** Room tone + ambient sounds under music (typing, gym sounds, etc.)

### Text Overlay Style
```
Time Headers: SF Pro Display Heavy, 60pt, White, centered
Activity Labels: SF Pro Display Medium, 36pt, White, centered
Subtitle Text: SF Pro Display Regular, 32pt, White, left-aligned, bottom third
    - Conversational, casual tone
    - Max 2 lines per subtitle
    - Natural thought process
```

### NutriSync Integration Strategy
**SUBTLE BUT CLEAR** - App appears naturally as part of productivity routine:
- Phone screens visible but not forced
- Quick glances, natural interactions
- Lime green UI (#C0FF73) stands out but doesn't dominate
- Show impact on energy/focus through subtitles
- Position as tool that enables the productive day, not the star

## 📝 Final Notes

### What Makes This Different from Generic Vlogs:
1. **Time-structured** - Clear progression, not random clips
2. **Calm energy** - Not hyperactive or loud
3. **Subtle product integration** - NutriSync is tool, not star
4. **Relatable struggle** - Real student life, not highlight reel
5. **Minimal text** - Let visuals do the work
6. **Consistent aesthetic** - Cohesive look throughout

### Key Message (Unspoken):
*"Structure your eating → Structure your day → Accomplish more"*

The vlog should leave viewers thinking:
- "I want my days to look like this"
- "That app actually seems useful"
- "This person has their life together (but it's attainable)"

### Authenticity is Key:
- Don't fake "perfect" meals
- Show real work (actual code, actual projects)
- Include small struggles (stuck on bug, tired, etc.)
- Let personality come through subtitles
- Film your ACTUAL day, not a staged version
