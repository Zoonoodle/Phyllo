## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Account Creation Flow
1. User completes Section 1 (basics) of onboarding
2. Account prompt automatically appears (if anonymous)

   - Continue with Email
   - Skip for Now
4. If account created:
   - Anonymous account linked with credentials
   - All data preserved
   - Auth state updated to authenticated
5. If skipped:
   - Preference saved to UserDefaults
   - Won't prompt again during onboarding

### Account Management Features

## üìù Key Decisions Made

1. **Prompt Timing**: After Section 1 (basics) when we have enough user context
2. **Skip Persistence**: Using UserDefaults to remember skip preference
3. **Account Deletion**: Complete removal of all user data from Firestore
4. **UI Approach**: Native SwiftUI with Apple's SignInWithAppleButton

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Privacy Policy/Terms URLs**: Currently using placeholder URLs (nutrisync.app/privacy)
2. **Email Validation**: Basic validation, could be enhanced
3. **Error Messages**: Using Firebase default messages, could be customized
4. **Analytics**: Events defined but not yet implemented

**PHASE 4: ACCOUNT UPGRADE COMPLETE**

The authentication and onboarding integration now includes a complete account upgrade system that balances user convenience with data security. Users can start immediately as guests and upgrade when ready.
